      <description>Locke Data will be up to some shenanigans of various stripes in the big smoke. We hope to see you at some of them!
June 26th &amp;#8212; Monday Introduction to R (Newcastle) I won&amp;#8217;t be in London for this but I&amp;#8217;ll be doing a day of Introduction to R in Newcastle. This is supporting the local user groups and costs up to £90 for the whole day.Intro to R in Newcastle, June 26th</description>

      <description>I recently delivered a day of training at SQLBits and I really upped my game in terms of infrastructure for it. The resultant solution was super smooth and mitigated all the install issues and preparation for attendees. This meant we got to spend the whole day doing R, instead of troubleshooting.
I&amp;#8217;m so happy with the solution for an online R training environment that I want to share the solution, so you can take it and use it for when you need to do training.</description>
