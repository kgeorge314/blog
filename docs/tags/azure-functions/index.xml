      <description>Last week, I blogged about building a no-code Q&amp;amp;A bot for your website. One little niggle I had with the bot was the response when it could match a user input to a Q&amp;amp;A. I wondered how to change &amp;#8220;No match found!&amp;#8221;.
I looked around the qnamaker.ai site and couldn&amp;#8217;t find a place I could change this. I submitted some feedback and the great people at the other of the Q&amp;amp;A site responded super quickly.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to have a live chat option for their site but I&amp;#8217;m frequently away, so I wanted something that people could talk to interactively. This is a perfect scenario for a Q&amp;amp;A bot. Microsoft takes a ton of the pain out of Q&amp;amp;A bots, and it was much easier than I thought to get it added to my WordPress blog. Here is a how to do it for your site.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I started my Stumbling Into series. I started but only got one in &amp;#8211; I was gonna talk about how I failed with Azure Functions next. I was failing because the docs outside C# (and node.js) were so limited that I found it difficult to get things done. However, I persevered and overcame a little bit of C#-ophobia and I can honestly say it has been so worth it.</description>
