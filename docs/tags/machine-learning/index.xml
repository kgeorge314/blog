      <description>Ok, this post is about one of my latest crazy/harebrained/whacky ideas.
I&amp;#8217;m fed up of having to carry my Galaxy Note 3 in my hand. I can&amp;#8217;t stand handbags and most women&amp;#8217;s clothing items don&amp;#8217;t have pockets or the pockets are insufficient. Given how easy it is to build a website these days, I thought I&amp;#8217;d become a sofa warrior for the campaign for pockets. I&amp;#8217;ve made a site and aim to make it an open &amp;amp; technical backend.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been asked by a few people recently about why I don&amp;#8217;t use Azure Machine Learning (ML). I answer that I don&amp;#8217;t use it yet, and the reason being that at the moment the robust development life-cycle isn&amp;#8217;t in place around it. I think that will change &amp;#8211; one of the great reasons for the acquisition of Revolution Analytics (in my opinion) is their DeployR system.
DeployR is essentially an R web service platform.</description>
