      <description>I mentioned in an earlier post about how I&amp;#8217;m revamping my presentation slides process but that I hadn&amp;#8217;t tackled the user experience of browsing my slides, which wasted lots of the effort I put in. To tackle this part of it, I&amp;#8217;ve made lockedata.uk using Hugo to be a way of finding and browsing presentations on R, SQL, and more. As Hugo is so easy, I thought I&amp;#8217;d throw in a quick Hugo walkthrough too so that you could build your own blog/slides/company site if you wanted to.</description>

      <description>I wrote a little while back about using Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs with R to first of all detect the language of pieces of text and then do sentiment analysis on them. I wasn&amp;#8217;t too happy with the some of the code as it was very inelegant. I knew I could code better than I had, especially as I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot more work with purrr recently. However, it had sat in drafts for a while.</description>

      <description>High-level info If you build a model and never update it you&amp;#8217;re missing a trick. Behaviours change so your model will tend to perform worse over time. You&amp;#8217;ve got to regularly refresh it, whether that&amp;#8217;s adjusting the existing model to fit the latest data (recalibration) or building a whole new model (retraining), but this means you&amp;#8217;ve got new versions of your model that you have to handle. You need to think about your methodology for versioning R model objects, ideally before you lose any versions.</description>

      <description>In this post, I describe the latest iteration of my automatic document production with R. It improves upon the methods used in Rtraining, and previous work on this topic can read by going to the auto deploying R documentation tag.
I keep banging on about this area because reproducible research / analytical document pipelines is an area I&amp;#8217;ve a keen interest in. I see it as a core part of DataOps as it&amp;#8217;s vital for helping us ensure our models and analysis are correct in data science and boosting our productivity.</description>

      <description>Following my post about logistic regressions, Ryan got in touch about one bit of building logistic regressions models that I didn&amp;#8217;t cover in much detail &amp;#8211; interpreting&amp;nbsp;regression coefficients. This post will hopefully help Ryan (and others) out.
This was so helpful. Thank you! I&#39;d love to see more about interpreting the glm coefficients.  &amp;mdash; Ryan (@RyanEs) April 21, 2017  What is a coefficient? Coefficients are what a line of best fit model produces.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: parameter re-use within rmarkdown YAML</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2017-05-08-r-quick-tip-sequential-yaml-headers-rmarkdown-parameter-re-use/</link>

      <description>Ever wondered how to make an rmarkdown title dynamic? Maybe, wanted to use a parameter in multiple locations? Maybe wanted to pass through a publication date? Advanced use of YAML headers can help!
Normally, when we write rmarkdown, we might use something like the basic YAML header that the rmarkdown template gives us.
--- title: &amp;quot;My report&amp;quot; date: &amp;quot;18th April, 2017&amp;quot; output: pdf_document ---  You may already know the trick about making the date dynamic to whatever date the report gets rendered on by using the inline R execution mode of rmarkdown to insert a value.</description>

      <description>A new version of HIBPwned has been accepted onto CRAN. This occurred yesterday so it could still be filtering into some mirrors.
HIBPwned is an R wrapper for the useful website HaveIBeenPwned and if you don&amp;#8217;t already utilise the package or the site &amp;#8211; you should. HaveIBeenPwned tells you when your details are included in data breaches. This is vital information to get quickly as it means you can sooner protect yourself from people trying to use the breach information to break into your accounts.</description>

https://t.co/WuyU9D6npK  &amp;mdash; Richie Cotton (@richierocks) May 1, 2017  It turns out awesome folks, George and Justin, had made a process whereby they can generate different distributions of points that retain the same summary statistics. They used this process for making some friends for Dino the Datasaurus who was created by Alberto Cairo. They made the data for Dino and the rest of the Datasaurus Dozen available for download.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: Upload multiple files in shiny and consolidate into a dataset</title>

      <description>In shiny, you can use the fileInput with the parameter multiple = TRUE to enable you to upload multiple files at once. But how do you process those multiple files in shiny and consolidate into a single dataset?
The bit we need from shiny is the input$param$fileinputpath value.
We can use lapply() with data.table&amp;#8216;s fread() to read multiple CSVs from the fileInput(). Then to consolidate the data, we can use data.</description>

      <description>I recently delivered a day of training at SQLBits and I really upped my game in terms of infrastructure for it. The resultant solution was super smooth and mitigated all the install issues and preparation for attendees. This meant we got to spend the whole day doing R, instead of troubleshooting.
I&amp;#8217;m so happy with the solution for an online R training environment that I want to share the solution, so you can take it and use it for when you need to do training.</description>

      <title>Logistic regressions (in R)</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2017-04-21-logistic-regressions-r/</link>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2017-04-21-logistic-regressions-r/</guid>
      <description>Logistic regressions are a great tool for predicting outcomes that are categorical. They use a transformation function based on probability to perform a linear regression. This makes them easy to interpret and implement in other systems.
Logistic regressions can be used to perform a classification for things like determining whether someone needs to go for a biopsy. They can also be used for a more nuanced view by using the probabilities of an outcome for thinks like prioritising interventions based on likelihood to default on a loan.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: Table parameters for rmarkdown reports</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2017-04-19-table-parameters-rmarkdown-reports/</link>

      <description>The recent(ish) advent of parameters in rmarkdown reports is pretty nifty but there&amp;#8217;s a little bit of behaviour that can come in handy but doesn&amp;#8217;t come across in the documentation. You can use table parameters for rmarkdown reports.
Previously, if you wanted to produce multiple reports based off a dataset, you would make the dataset available and then perform filtering in the report. Now we can pass the filtered data directly to the report, which keeps all the filtering logic in one place.</description>

May 19th &amp;#8211; Data science project in a day We&amp;#8217;ll be in Kiev, Ukraine, doing a whole data science project in a day. This is intended to give people a little bit of code, process, and critical thinking along the whole data science workflow. This will enable folks to see how it hangs together and decide where and how much they want to invest their learning in future.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in class, I taught some fundamentals of API consumption in R. As it was aligned to some Microsoft content, we first used &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s API and then played with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Cognitive Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; Text Analytics API. This brief post overviews what you need to get started, and how you can chain consecutive calls to these APIs in order to perform multi-lingual sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: See improved code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/using-purrr-with-apis/&#34;&gt;Using purrr with APIs – revamping my code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big part of why I&amp;#8217;ve launched Locke Data is so that I can give back more to my communities. I want to give more time and more support to others. One of the first steps is doing some activities that give financial support to community groups without damaging my startup cashflow! Community R workshops that fund local user groups is the first activity I&amp;#8217;ll be trialling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s involved, and what you might want to consider if you&amp;#8217;d like to be a part of this endeavour:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time series data is an important area of analysis, especially if you do a lot of web analytics. To be able to analyse time series effectively, it helps to understand the interaction between general seasonality in activity and the underlying trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactions between trend and seasonality are typically classified as either additive or multiplicative. This post looks at how we can classify a given time series as one or the other to facilitate further processing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) was a concept developed 20 years ago now. I&amp;#8217;ve read about it in various data mining and related books and it&amp;#8217;s come in very handy over the years. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll outline what the model is and why you should know about it, even if it has that terribly out of vogue phrase data mining in it! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m fed up of having to carry my Galaxy Note 3 in my hand. I can&amp;#8217;t stand handbags and most women&amp;#8217;s clothing items don&amp;#8217;t have pockets or the pockets are insufficient. Given how easy it is to build a website these days, I thought I&amp;#8217;d become a sofa warrior for the campaign for pockets. I&amp;#8217;ve made a site and aim to make it an open &amp;amp; technical backend.</description>

      <description>Slack all the things! OK, if you haven&amp;#8217;t heard of it before Slack is kinda like IRC, kinda like Dropbox, kinda like a lot of things &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a neat place to bring together communications between your team or community, and the integrations allow you to pipe in external feeds like twitter activity or RSS. It&amp;#8217;s a great way of collaborating online and I&amp;#8217;ve found it especially useful not just within a company but within a global community.</description>

      <description>Haveibeenpwned.com is a fantastic service that helps people find out if they&amp;#8217;ve been involved in a data breach. HIBPwned is an R wrapper for that service.
Recently, due to abuse of the system, Troy Hunt had to add a limit of one request per 1.5s.
The new version published on CRAN last night adds a delay into each call so that we can continue to use it in R.
Check out the package on CRAN for vignettes and more information on the package.</description>

      <title>Giving back with code</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-07-20-giving-back-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-07-20-giving-back-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From code in answers on Stack Overflow to R packages or full programs, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of code being written and given away. This post examines some of the reasons why the people writing all that code do it, why you should consider giving back with code, and how you can get started. Finally, I cap it all off with perspectives from some of my favourite coders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#getstarted&#34;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives&#34;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why you should consider writing code and making it available for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;altruistic&#34;&gt;Altruistic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re writing something to achieve a task, odds are someone else would have to write the same code &amp;#8211; why not help them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;re using a lot of open source software, whether you realise it or not. By open sourcing your code, you get to pay it forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give others something to contribute to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown quantities are risky hires, put your code out there for the world to see and employers get to see what you can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop your skills for the next job, the one that requires you to be more skilled in something than you are now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to interact with a lot of different people who you build credibility with, and hopefully friendships!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-oneself&#34;&gt;For oneself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, the more code you write, the better your coding skills so if you want to improve your skills this is an ideal way to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the sheer fun of doing cool stuff, especially if you don&amp;#8217;t get to do cool stuff in the day job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do it &amp;#8220;the way it should be done&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>I love user groups and I always want there to be more. I&amp;#8217;m not a perfect organiser but I run reasonable groups. When I see organisers doing it badly, it makes me sad. There&amp;#8217;s lots of great ways to run a user group, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d cover some of the bad ways to run a user group. The anti-patterns if you will 😀

      <description>In R, we can use a file called .Rprofile to do things in R based on a number of triggers. One thing I&amp;#8217;ve done is give myself a DIY notification of how many data breaches I&amp;#8217;ve been involved in!
First of all, you need a file called .Rprofile that&amp;#8217;s stored in your working directory. Some useful resources about .Rprofiles can be found on .Rprofile CRAN docs and an .Rprofile intro.</description>

      <description>Part of my (slowly) working pipeline of coding projects has been an R package that wraps the fantastic HaveIBeenPwned.com API.
If you&amp;#8217;re not already familiar with HaveIBeenPwned, rectify the situation, NOW! Don&amp;#8217;t worry about continuing to read the rest of the post; getting yourself signed up for account breach notifications is way more important!Go now!
/giphy run
With that stern admonishment out of the way&amp;#8230;
HIBPwned is a feature complete R package that allows you to use every (currently) available endpoint of the API.</description>

      <description>Voting for 2 of the 3 locations for satRday conferences will be closing at the end of May 31st (GMT). It&amp;#8217;s been a phenomenal turnout with more than 1,500 votes so far.
You can still vote if you haven&amp;#8217;t already!
EU status Budapest, Hungary, is where Gergely will be throwing the EU event and it&amp;#8217;s tentatively set for September.
US status Chicago started out with a close runner of Washington DC, but that all changed as folks realised they could visit Puerto Rico and get fantastic learning, or Puerto Rico has for more R people than my tenuous grasp of geography led me to expect.</description>

      <description>satRdays, free R conferences, are a project being supported by the R Consortium. When Gergely and I submitted our proposal, we said we&amp;#8217;d be supporting three conferences:
 Budapest, Hungary (Gergely&amp;#8217;s home turf) Somewhere in the US Somewhere else in the world  We&amp;#8217;ve had an overwhelming response with 40 submitted conferences but for the fully-funded ones, there can only be three. We are looking at how the runners up can do the next wave of events but we want to get the ball rolling on the first three.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing in the series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/tag/shiny-design-patterns/&#34;&gt;shiny module design patterns&lt;/a&gt;, this post covers how to pass all the inputs from one module to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; from within the server call. Store the &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt; result in a variable. Pass the variable into arguments for other modules. Access the variable like you would &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/shiny-module-design-pattern-pass-inputs-one-module-another/&#34;&gt;shiny modules design pattern of passing an input value to many modules&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m now going to look at a more complex shiny module design pattern: passing an input from one module to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return the input in a reactive expression from within the server call. Store the &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt; result in a variable. Pass the variable into arguments for other modules. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Travis? Make sure you use a Github PAT</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-04-12-using-travis-make-sure-use-github-pat/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2016 10:27:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-04-12-using-travis-make-sure-use-github-pat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in the fantastic situation where lots of people are using &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; to test their R packages or use it to test and deploy their analytics/ documentation / anything really. It&amp;#8217;s popularity has been having a negative side-effect recently though! GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting&#34;&gt;rate limits&lt;/a&gt; API access to 5000 requests per hour so sometimes there are more R related jobs running on Travis per hour than this limit, causing builds to error typically with a message that includes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;403 forbidden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This error will cause your build to fail, even if you didn&amp;#8217;t do anything wrong. To solve it short-term you can wait a little while and restart your build.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_61598&#34; style=&#34;width: 768px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium_large wp-image-61598&#34; src=&#34;http://res.cloudinary.com/lockedata/image/upload/h_131,w_750/v1499850336/restartbuilds_hsvpmp.png&#34; alt=&#34;How to restart a build in Travis-CI&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;How to restart a build in Travis-CI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a very short-termist solution and does not solve the problem for future you or other users of the service. The real solution to resolving this issue is to get off the default API access credentials and use your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R integration in Travis makes good use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools&#34;&gt;devtools&lt;/a&gt;. The devtools package looks for an environment variable called &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_PAT&lt;/code&gt; that holds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/&#34;&gt;personal access token&lt;/a&gt; (PAT) for using the GitHub API and if it doesn&amp;#8217;t find one it uses a default token. When we get our own PAT and store it in Travis, devtools will pick up our token and use it, meaning you&amp;#8217;ll only ever get rate limited if you do more than 5000 builds in an hour, which is an achievement I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shiny module design patterns: Pass a single input to multiple modules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/shiny-developer-conference-registration-19153967031&#34;&gt;Shiny Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; back in January, I endeavoured to learn about shiny modules and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/declutter-a-shiny-reports-code-v2-0/&#34;&gt;overhaul an application&lt;/a&gt; using them in the space of two days. I succeeded and almost immediately switched onto other projects, thereby losing most of the hard-won knowledge! As I rediscover shiny modules and start putting them into more active use, I&amp;#8217;ll be blogging about design patterns. This post takes you through the case of multiple modules receiving the same input value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick overall config input objects at the app level and pass them in a reactive expression to &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt;. Pass the results in as an extra argument into subsequent modules. These are reactive so don&amp;#8217;t forget the brackets. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/HIBPwned&#34;&gt;HIBPwned&lt;/a&gt; package, I consume the &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned&lt;/a&gt; API and return back a list object with an element for each email address. Each element holds a data.frame of breach data or a stub response with a single column data.frame containing NA. Elements are named with the email addresses they relate to. I had a list of data.frames and I wanted a consolidated data.frame (well, I always want a data.table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter data.table &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table&#34;&gt;data.table&lt;/a&gt; has a very cool, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15673550/why-is-rbindlist-better-than-rbind&#34;&gt;very fast&lt;/a&gt; function named &lt;code&gt;rbindlist()&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a list of data.frames and consolidates them into one data.table, which can, of course, be handled as a data.frame if you didn&amp;#8217;t want to use data.table for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Auto-deploying documentation: better change tracking of artefacts</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-04-04-auto-deploying-documentation-better-change-tracking-artefacts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 11:04:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-04-04-auto-deploying-documentation-better-change-tracking-artefacts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my never-ending quest to deploy documentation better, I&amp;#8217;ve made yet another tweak to my scripts that deploy R vignettes or Rmarkdown documents to the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch of my github repositories via Travis-CI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script from &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/11/travis_ci_gh_pages.html&#34;&gt;Robert Flight&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s provided the basis for most of this work does something specific to update the web facing branch of the repository. It would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a blank repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the requisite files to the repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add and commit them to the repo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force the repo to overwrite the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This had the unfortunate consequence of losing the history of what was previously hosted on the branch and could not tell me what commit to my development branches was responsible for a version of the docs. It took a little bit of playing but the revised script now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clones the gh-pages branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds the requisite files into the reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add and commit them to the repo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push the changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an environment variable ($TRAVIS_COMMIT) the commit message is the commit ID for the latest commit in the build that occurs on Travis, making it very easy to see what changes triggered a documentation update.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>This is a brief update on my packages not currently on CRAN: tfsR, HIBPwned, and mockaRoo.
tfsR tfsR is designed to help you work git repositories in Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). I wrote the package a while ago and it has/had just two functions; one for getting a list of git repositories, and one for making a new git repository. The release of httr 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m very pleased to say that the R Consortium agreed to the support the satRday project!
The idea kicked off in November and I was over the moon with the response from the community, then we garnered support before submitting to the Consortium and I must have looped the moon a few times as we had more than 500 responses. Now the R Consortium are supporting us and we can turn all that enthusiasm into action.</description>

      <title>HIBPwned, an R package for HaveIBeenPwned.com</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The answer in life to the inevitable question of &amp;#8220;How can I do that in R?&amp;#8221; should be &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a package for that&amp;#8221;. So when I wanted to query &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) to check whether a bunch of emails had been involved in data breaches and there wasn&amp;#8217;t an R package for HIBP, it meant that the responsibility for making one landed on my shoulders. Now, you can see if your accounts are at risk with the R package for HaveIBeenPwned.com, &lt;strong&gt;HIBPwned&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_61581&#34; style=&#34;width: 768px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://res.cloudinary.com/lockedata/image/upload/h_139,w_750/v1499850337/hibp_os8t5d.png&#34; alt=&#34;Have I Been Pwned | HaveIBeenPwned.com&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;142&#34; class=&#34;size-medium_large wp-image-61581&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Have I Been Pwned | HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is currently available on github @ &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/HIBPwned&#34;&gt;stephlocke/HIBPwned&lt;/a&gt;, but I intend to submit to CRAN after getting some feedback from y&amp;#8217;all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSH tunnels on Windows for R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve had to get to grips with SSH tunnels. SSH tunnels are really useful for maintaining remote network integrity and work in a secure fashion. It is, however, a pain to open PuTTY and log in all the time, mainly because I couldn&amp;#8217;t script it in R! It&amp;#8217;s been a trial, but like most things it turned out to be pretty simple in the end so I thought I&amp;#8217;d share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-8217-s-required&#34;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s required?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html&#34;&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>mockaRoo – making realistic test data in R</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-03-08-mockaroo-making-realistic-test-data-in-r/</link>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-03-08-mockaroo-making-realistic-test-data-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m building stuff in R like packages, models, etc. I find myself wishing for realistic looking test data without having to resort to getting data off my production server. To that end I&amp;#8217;ve been on the hunt for a way of generating decent test data. A few months back I stumbled upon the neat system &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mockaroo.com/&#34;&gt;Mockaroo&lt;/a&gt; which provides a GUI to build some data that suits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mockaroo is a really impressive service with a wide spread of different data types. They also have simple ways of adding things like within group differences to data so that you can mock realistic class differences. They use the freemium model so you can get a thousand rows per download, which is pretty sweet. The big BUT you can feel coming on is this &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a GUI! I don&amp;#8217;t want to have spend time hand cranking a data extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, they have a GUI for getting data too and it&amp;#8217;s pretty simply to use so I&amp;#8217;ve started making a package for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started the package on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/mockaRoo&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and will be developing it over the next month or two. It&amp;#8217;s up and working, but only in the most primitive way as I&amp;#8217;d like to get some feedback from folks who might find this useful around how the interface for generating your desired data schema should work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upcoming R for Microsoft training days</title>

      <description>In May, I will be delivering two R for Microsoft training days. These two days will focus on some R fundamentals and applying these fundamentals within the Microsoft Data Platform. These training days are ideal if you know one half of the components &amp;#8211; whether that&amp;#8217;s the R bit or the Microsoft BI bit. Either way, you&amp;#8217;ll learn about the other half.
SQLBits SQLBits XV is being held in Liverpool this year and my training day is on May 4th.</description>

      <title>Declutter a shiny report’s code v2.0</title>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2016-03-03-declutter-a-shiny-reports-code-v2-0/</guid>
      <description>I wrote a year ago on a way to declutter shiny report code which involved putting objects into a sourced file, however, at that point in time the solution was a bit brittle and clunky. Now there&amp;#8217;s a better way to develop shiny applications &amp;#8211; shiny modules.
In October, RStudio introduced the concept of modules which involves abstracting code out into self-contained blocks.
Modules are ways of batching your code into discrete chunks &amp;#8211; you keep all the code related to the inputs, manipulation, and presentation for doing something in one module.</description>

      <description>I talked back in November about the idea of an RSaturday, which were free community-driven conferences on R. Since then, we created a GitHub repository and started hammering out the details for satRdays. The current proposal consists of:
 A name: satRday A proposition: Free/cheap (&amp;lt;£30) conferences organised by user groups around the world. Attendees get more access to training in R, with a much lower cost-barrier. We develop more speakers on R.</description>

      <description>In my last post on using GitHub, Travis-CI, and rmarkdown/knitr for automatically building and deploying documentation, I covered how I was able to do it with a containerised approach so things were faster. I also said my Rtraining repository was still too brittle to blog about. This has changed &amp;#8211; WOO HOO!
The main thanks for that goes out to the new package ezknitr from Dean Attali. ezknitr takes the pain out of working directories, making my hierarchies much more resilient.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/optirum-gini-like-a-wizard/&#34;&gt;wrote about how I was waiting&lt;/a&gt; to be able to release &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/optiRum&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt; to CRAN, well data.table 1.9.6 was released (a key dependency for new functionality) and I&amp;#8217;ve finally had some quiet time. So optiRum 1.37.1 is now accepted and trickling through the CRAN publish processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQLSaturdays but for R?</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-11-04-sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Proposal now being developed after fantastic community support. Check out satRdays on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and contribute your opinions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a contact from a very nice chap in Dallas a month ago about whether in the R world we do anything like SQLSaturdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the SQLSaturdays he said was not that they&amp;#8217;re free (well it helps!) but that they&amp;#8217;re on his time. Developing his skills was something he couldn&amp;#8217;t get signed off by his boss so he wanted to be able to do it by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to the question of whether there are local(ish) weekend conferences happening regularly for R, my answer was &amp;#8220;not really&amp;#8221; and it&amp;#8217;s a shame because the R community is fantastic. I started thinking about why we don&amp;#8217;t have them and what would be needed to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free / cheap regional small-medium conferences are a must for growing user knowledge and speakers in R.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Since August, I&amp;#8217;ve had the pleasure to work at Mango Solutions, a data science consultancy, as a Principal Consultant.
In that time, I&amp;#8217;ve been to EARL London, SQL Relay, and SQL in the City, so conference season has been in full swing with more to come in the form EARL Boston next week. Surprisingly, I&amp;#8217;ve also found some time to help some customers out and write some blog posts over on the Mango site.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I presented a &lt;a href=&#34;https://1drv.ms/p/s!AiZm2P6YHtSfjye0xDn_fuL80eSp&#34;&gt;lightning talk on DataOps&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlinthecity.red-gate.com/london-2015/&#34;&gt;SQL in the City&lt;/a&gt;. It was a fantastic day and a great opportunity to catch up with how the database side of things is evolving to embrace &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lightning talk was titled &lt;em&gt;DataOps &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a thing (honest)&lt;/em&gt; and focused on what is essentially DevOps ported out of the developer sphere and into the data professional sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>SQL Relay is back on tour! Our 6th event sees us yet again touring the country bringing awesome speakers to eight cities over 2 weeks.
As usual we&amp;#8217;re improving things:
 A new platform called Attendee.Events which allows easier registration &amp;amp; speaker submission A whole bunch of webinars planned to get in the swing of things More breadth &amp;#8211; this year each event includes a dedicated track to R, machine learning etc, on top of SQL Server and business intelligence More content &amp;#8211; instead of swapping out existing slots for breadth, we added more tracks A green initiative &amp;#8230; see it on the day Improved speaker experience &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re building on last year&amp;#8217;s fun bus with the help of SQL Sentry to make it easier and more fun for speakers to do multiple events, as well as offering first timers some mentoring as most of the organisers are also speakers  You&amp;#8217;ll see a lot of announcements about Relay over the next few months, but I hope this little post inspires you to check out our events 😀</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in April, for SQL Saturday Exeter I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/sqlsaturday-exeter-2015/&#34;&gt;my first ever full day of training&lt;/a&gt;. Next month sees me taking my second tilt at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign up for my R training day, July 24th, in Manchester you can go to the pre-con homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may say so myself, it&amp;#8217;s a steal at £99 but then they all are! For instance, Andrew Fryer&amp;#8217;s training day covers the Machine Learning use of R via Azure, so if you&amp;#8217;re already wrangling numbers like a pro in R, understanding how you can apply it to snazzy webservices is a great way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom LaTeX Beamer style templates for rmarkdown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been producing presentations via R using &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt; and outputting to either ioslides or slidify. That was excellent, because I could provide a CSS that customised the look and feel (relatively) easily*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I wanted to produce a PDF version, I couldn&amp;#8217;t make ones that look as good as the pure LaTeX versions I could make on &lt;a href=&#34;http://overleaf.com&#34;&gt;overleaf.com&lt;/a&gt;. So I started RTFMing when I wanted to replicate the look and feel from my presentation, The LaTeX Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend a huge amount of time on it, so this little story of hack and slash may feel a bit dirty to you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-vignettes&#34;&gt;Multiple vignettes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/&#34;&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt; I show how I pushed the tfsR vignette to &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;, which involved copying it and renaming it to index.html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t work if I had multiple vignettes that I wanted to be accessible online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An index.html file&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A way of extracting any number of html files from the vignette folder&lt;/p&gt;

Some of it uses currently experimental data.table functionality so I&amp;#8217;m eagerly awaiting the release to CRAN to deliver optiRum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some brief overviews of &lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; functionality contained in the package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated documentation hosting on github via Travis-CI</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-06-01-automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to cover how you can use continuous integration and source control to build and host documentation (or any other static HTML) for free, and in a way that updates every time your code changes. I&amp;#8217;ll cover the generic capability, and then how I apply this to my simplest package, tfsR. In a later post (once I&amp;#8217;ve cracked the best method to do it) I&amp;#8217;ll cover my more complex use case of multiple documents and a dynamically constructed index page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: This is kicked off from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/11/travis_ci_gh_pages.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from Robert Flight about applying to the technique to R package vignettes. It&amp;#8217;s a very useful post but it was quite specific to his situation and I wanted to understand the principles behind it before I started extending it to my more complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A linux machine (so you can test your bash script that Travis-CI will run)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R (for following the specific instructions)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an OAUTH token from github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add OAUTH token to travis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a *.sh file that gets your HTML (depending on circumstance, you may also need to generate it) and pushes to gh-pages branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include your .sh file in the &lt;code&gt;after_success&lt;/code&gt; part of your travis file&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit &amp;amp; push!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Well SQL Saturday Exeter flew by. T&amp;#8217;was great catching up with people, seeing folks learn how to use (old &amp;amp; new) tools better, and just generally watching everyone having a great time at one of the best organised conferences I have the pleasure of going to.
Here are links to all the slide decks etc that we presented this weekend:
 My R: analysis to integration training day notes &amp;amp; source code My agile BI slide deck My Shiny: dashboards in R slide deck &amp;amp; source code Oz&amp;#8217;s SSRS: Beyond the basics slide deck &amp;amp; source code  If you attended any of our sessions, give us some constructive criticism!</description>

      <title>Easy Continuous Integration for R</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-04-20-easy-continuous-integration-for-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2015 09:06:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-04-20-easy-continuous-integration-for-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;excellent guidance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/&#34;&gt;tooling&lt;/a&gt; on making R packages, it&amp;#8217;s becoming really easy to make a package to hold your R functionality. This has a host of benefits, not least source control (via GitHub) and unit testing (via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;testthat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package). Once you have a package and unit tests, a great way of making sure that as you change things you don&amp;#8217;t break them is to perform &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; time you make a change, your package is built and thoroughly checked for any issues. If issues are found the &amp;#8220;build&amp;#8217;s broke&amp;#8221; and you have to fix it ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest, cheapest, and fastest way of setting up continuous integration for R stuff is to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.com/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt;, which is free if you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as a remote server for your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB &amp;#8211; it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be your only remote server&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>optiRum – gini like a wizard</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-04-16-optirum-gini-like-a-wizard/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optiRum/&#34; title=&#34;optiRum on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt;, the R package I built and maintain for Optimum on CRAN has gained some extra functions recently. Some of it uses currently experimental data.table functionality so I&amp;#8217;m eagerly awaiting the release to CRAN to deliver optiRum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some brief overviews of &lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; functionality contained in the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of regression models and one of the common tools for assessing a regression&amp;#8217;s ability to accurately model an event is to produce a Gini chart and a Gini coefficient. The higher the Gini coefficient, the more your model is able to discriminate probability accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simplify the process of producing gini charts (&lt;code&gt;giniChart&lt;/code&gt;) and coefficients (&lt;code&gt;giniCoef&lt;/code&gt;) so that I get a chart in one simple step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood this uses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AUC/&#34; title=&#34;AUC on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AUC&lt;/a&gt; package to get the coefficient, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/&#34; title=&#34;scales on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; to format it and &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/&#34; title=&#34;ggplot2 documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; to produce the chart. Using ggplot leads to a better looking chart that can also be tweaked to suit your needs since a ggplot object is returned by the function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>For my precon on R at the end of the month I&amp;#8217;m working on the takeaway &amp;#8212; the handout. This&amp;#8217;ll be thing that makes the training day able to be put into practice immediately, and refills all those drink and sleep depleted neurons back up with R knowledge.
One of the things is a simple data.table cookbook. If you&amp;#8217;re a data.table user, what other tasks do you think should be on there?</description>

      <title>Working with Azure Blob Storage, some notes</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-04-06-working-with-azure-blob-storage-rest-api/</link>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-04-06-working-with-azure-blob-storage-rest-api/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working on building a snazzy &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/Rtraining/blob/master/inst/slidedecks/shiny/Dashboards.Rmd&#34; title=&#34;My shiny presentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shiny&lt;/a&gt; app that a) drops the inputs/parameter values into &lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/&#34; title=&#34;Azure storage intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blob storage&lt;/a&gt; and b) uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/stream-analytics/&#34; title=&#34;Stream Analytics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stream Analytics&lt;/a&gt; to query the values and present back what people are saying at the moment. This&amp;#8217;ll be a fab tool for &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/r-pre-con-sqlsat-exeter/&#34; title=&#34;My R Pre-Con: SQLSat Exeter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my pre-con next month&lt;/a&gt; if I can get it working in time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting it working, does however mean utilising the &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179355.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Storage API documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Azure Blob Storage API&lt;/a&gt; in R which I confess is much harder than expected, especially after the ease of using the Visual Studio Online API for &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/bride-of-frankenstein-tfs-r/&#34; title=&#34;Bride of Frankenstein: TFS + R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tfsR&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, I thought I&amp;#8217;d write-up some of my findings before I do a bigger write-up that illustrates how to do everything (in R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working my way through an &lt;a href=&#34;http://justazure.com/azure-blob-storage-part-one-introduction/&#34; title=&#34;Just Azure - working with blob storage&#34;&gt;intro to azure storage&lt;/a&gt; on the (hopefully reasonable) expectation that more knowledge will make it easier to work with. There&amp;#8217;s additionally the &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd135733.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Blob Storage REST API&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online reference&lt;/a&gt;, although I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/api/overview&#34; title=&#34;Visual Studio Online REST API documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VSO REST API&lt;/a&gt; documentation easier to understand and get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been asked by a few people recently about why I don&amp;#8217;t use Azure Machine Learning (ML). I answer that I don&amp;#8217;t use it yet, and the reason being that at the moment the robust development life-cycle isn&amp;#8217;t in place around it. I think that will change &amp;#8211; one of the great reasons for the acquisition of Revolution Analytics (in my opinion) is their DeployR system.
DeployR is essentially an R web service platform.</description>

      <title>Bride of Frankenstein: TFS &#43; R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The unholy abomination of trying to use TFS as my central repository for my R code over the past year has been tough and you may or not be looking at the screen as if I&amp;#8217;m a crazy fool for even trying. Of course, now I have good news, because I&amp;#8217;ve broken the back of the main issue I had with TFS. The crucial link was being able to programatically create Git repositories within a single project for small projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the API, I&amp;#8217;ve been able to write an &lt;a title=&#34;tfsR&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/tfsR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R package&lt;/a&gt; with functions that now save me at least 15 minutes of time and effort each time I want a new project. So I can happily holler &amp;#8220;IT&amp;#8217;S ALIVE!!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entering into the world of SQL Server around the same time as the 2008 release has meant that until the past couple of years, change in the Microsoft BI world only happened in dribs and drabs for me. SQL Server and it&amp;#8217;s BI components were stable server products and the focus was on getting data and optimising &amp;#8220;central reporting&amp;#8221;. Recently though things have started to massively change due to Azure and Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer part of Server &amp;amp; Tools where products were considered in silos, SQL Server and BI are now part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2015/01/30/increasing-visibility-for-our-customers-announcing-the-cloud-platform-roadmap-site.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Cloud Platform roadmap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s now a means of delivering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.microsoft.com/ceo/bold-ambition/index.html&#34; title=&#34;Satya Nadella&#39;s vision email&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud-first vision&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft have aligned themselves to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Shiny reports are awesome, but they sure do end up with many lines of code when adding lots of inputs and outputs. A ui.R file can rapidly exceed 50 lines of code and I prefer to keep things more compact. The best way I&amp;#8217;ve found of doing that in other languages and in R is to modularise my code &amp;#8211; break it down into independent chunks. Shiny already does this by having a server() and ui() section and allowing you to source other files.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I built a pretty sweet web service in R as part of the day job. However, not being well-versed in stuff like object-oriented programming, I did not do the best job of making the flow of my program particularly clear or robust. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t take multiple inputs properly and I found it to be tough to test. In spare moments, I took to cogitating how to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried simply refactoring some of the functions but found my structure too cumbersome to allow much change. I tried starting afresh with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html&#34; title=&#34;Advanced R - OO programming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;S4 system&lt;/a&gt; but was soon in a death spiral of class proliferation and no experience in how to stop it. After dabbling with different methods, I was getting pretty frustrated &amp;#8211; I want my code to be better and more maintainable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html&#34; title=&#34;magrittr vignette on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;magrittr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-magrittr&#34;&gt;About magrittr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;magrittr&lt;/code&gt; was designed to better facilitate &lt;a href=&#34;http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html&#34; title=&#34;R for functional programming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; based on piping inputs from one function to another. It&amp;#8217;s the same paradigm as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/ebookv2/archive/2012/03/12/chapter-5-the-powershell-pipeline.aspx&#34; title=&#34;PowerShell Pipe operator explained&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PowerShell operator &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can more succinctly pass an input through various transformation steps (in contrast to my initial method) with a lot less code. The ability to add conditional functions or even new functions on the fly (aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function&#34; title=&#34;Lambda functions on wikipedia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lambda functions&lt;/a&gt;) with a similarly low code burden gives the added benefit of helping with branching logic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R on Windows – weird user name gotcha</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oz and I being the lazy so and so&amp;#8217;s that we are, share a profile and use it across all our devices. Our username is &amp;#8220;Steph &amp;amp; Oz&amp;#8221; which means the user folder that Windows has for us is &lt;code&gt;C:UsersSteph &amp;amp; Oz&lt;/code&gt;. Having spaces and special characters is generally not recommended, and gives interesting issues when using R, primarily at initialization and when trying to do package installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, R will try make the user&amp;#8217;s personal folder the directory which it works under, i.e. limiting its impact on the computer overall, but it&amp;#8217;s Unix/Linux roots mean that it doesn&amp;#8217;t like you doing whacky things like ampersands in folder names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result with ours is to cause this error on load:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error installing package: Error: ERROR: no packages specified&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Oz&amp;#8217; is not recognized as an internal or external command,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;operable program or batch file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I covered in &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/sqlsaturday-exeter-2015/&#34; title=&#34;SQLSaturday Exeter 2015&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my post on SQLSaturday Exeter&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m going to be doing a full day of R training on &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlsatexeter.azurewebsites.net/?page_id=342&#34; title=&#34;SQLSaturday Exeter, Steph Locke Pre-con details&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;April 24th&lt;/a&gt; that takes you from cabin boy to first mate in a day. You can&amp;#8217;t be captain because I&amp;#8217;m Captain&amp;#8230; until you go back to your own ship&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you can be captain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend my day of training about R if you&amp;#8217;d like to learn R, best practices, and how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organised speaking – Intro to R case study</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-21-organised-speaking-intro-r-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 09:48:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-21-organised-speaking-intro-r-case-study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/organised-speaking-iterative-development/&#34; title=&#34;Organised speaking – presentation design&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iterative presentation design post&lt;/a&gt; I promised a case study. I thought I&amp;#8217;d cover my most presented session &lt;em&gt;Intro to R&lt;/em&gt;, in future called &lt;em&gt;Knowing your Rs from your elbow&lt;/em&gt; courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/fatherjack&#34; title=&#34;Father Jack&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@FatherJack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-history&#34;&gt;A brief history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I&amp;#8217;ve been using R for the past couple of years and spent the first months struggling with it, I wanted to give a presentation that I would have wanted to see at the beginning. Not one about random bagging and a bunch of other stats but what are the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; ways to do the fundamentals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connecting to my database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performing data manipulations, summaries and updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;charting my data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;producing reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few packages cover these awesomely and are much better than base R so whilst I was tackling a massive stats project, the things which took the time and stress were things I could have avoided with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my intro to R, takes people through the things I wish I&amp;#8217;d been taken through thus making those first few months of R pleasant, happy times!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: The first CaRdiff R User Group meeting</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-14-review-first-cardiff-r-user-group-meeting/</link>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-14-review-first-cardiff-r-user-group-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/&#34; title=&#34;CaRdiff R User Group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cardiff R User Group&lt;/a&gt; event. There were 6 people registered out of 24 CaRdiffians. In the end we had 8 people show up &amp;#8211; so a whopping third of our current membership base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we sat around the booth eating chips and drinking beer, we covered our experiences learning R to date, the trials and tribulations of our jobs and why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t drop a barbell on your nose. We had great discussions and most of us came away with new R functionality to look at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to initially go with the three session formats I&amp;#8217;d proposed and see how things go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219775500/&#34; title=&#34;First TalkR session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TalkRs&lt;/a&gt;: evening events with talks and socialising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219691058/&#34; title=&#34;First LearnRs session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LearnRs&lt;/a&gt;: after work sessions focused on learning some new bit of R&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219476537/&#34; title=&#34;First LunchRs session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LunchRs&lt;/a&gt;: quick lunchtime sessions to talk through a problem with someone else and hopefully solve it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conference sessions – basic web scraping in R</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-11-some-basic-web-scraping-in-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit sad but I enjoy dissecting what sessions are submitted to conferences I&amp;#8217;m involved in or speak at. Instead of doing it primarily by eye, I&amp;#8217;ve started dabbling in web scraping in R to do it. Initially, I used RCurl and my latest snippet uses rvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first snippet for &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlbits.com&#34; title=&#34;SQLBits&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; bit of R code uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/&#34; title=&#34;RCurl on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RCurl&lt;/a&gt; but it&amp;#8217;s cumbersome, plus for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/372/schedule.aspx&#34; title=&#34;SQLSaturday Exeter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday Exeter&lt;/a&gt; there is SSL to contend with. Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/&#34; title=&#34;rvest on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rvest&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy and it was an excellent excuse to get around to using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/&#34; title=&#34;magrittr on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;magrittr&lt;/a&gt;, Hadley Wickham&amp;#8217;s pipe code paradigm for R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogger tip: I also wanted the opportunity to see how Gists imported into WordPress &amp;#8211; you just c&amp;amp;p the url in (into the code, no URL markup) and WordPress automatically pulls in the Gist. For more info on this see &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/&#34; title=&#34;Wordpress support - Gist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WordPress&amp;#8217; article on Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Not quite part of being organised at speaking, but bundled up in part of my scheduling constraints for speaking is when I&amp;#8217;m throwing user group events. Here&amp;#8217;s the details of the user groups I&amp;#8217;m planning on throwing to meet my goal of 1 user group event a month (not including lunch time sessions!)
SQL Server I run the SQL Server user group in Cardiff and have done a few years &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m not giving it up any time soon.</description>

      <title>Starting the Cardiff R User Group</title>
      <link>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-09-starting-the-cardiff-r-user-group/</link>

      <guid>http://lockedata.uk/itsalockeblog/2015-01-09-starting-the-cardiff-r-user-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days any hobby of mine ends up with a user group if there isn&amp;#8217;t one already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of value I derive from being able to hear experts in their fields talk about whether they&amp;#8217;re on stage or in the audience is phenomenal. Also, it&amp;#8217;s really great way to meet like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the benefits in mind, 2 years of R under my belt, and a new starter in work, the time seemed ripe for an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;  title=&#34;Cardiff R&#34;&gt;R user group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-r&#34;&gt;What is R?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R is a statistical language for doing all sorts of analytics based on many different types of data and it&amp;#8217;s also an open source platform that allows people to extend the base functionality.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/about.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt; are available from the horse&amp;#8217;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-give-it-a-go&#34;&gt;How can I give it a go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; an awesome development environment for R.  There is also an excellent online &lt;a href=&#34;http://tryr.codeschool.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R learning site&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not recommend sticking with just R &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re used to a lot more convenience and good development bits and bobs like IntelliSense and Rstudio really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
