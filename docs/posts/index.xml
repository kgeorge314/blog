      <description>I mentioned in an earlier post about how I&amp;#8217;m revamping my presentation slides process but that I hadn&amp;#8217;t tackled the user experience of browsing my slides, which wasted lots of the effort I put in. To tackle this part of it, I&amp;#8217;ve made lockedata.uk using Hugo to be a way of finding and browsing presentations on R, SQL, and more. As Hugo is so easy, I thought I&amp;#8217;d throw in a quick Hugo walkthrough too so that you could build your own blog/slides/company site if you wanted to.</description>

      <description>T-SQL TuesdayFor T-SQL Tuesday #91 the topic is databases and devops. Grant Fritchey asks us:
 How do we approach DevOps as developers, DBAs, report writers, analysts and database developers? How do we deal with data persistence, process, source control and all the rest of the tools and mechanisms, and most importantly, culture, that would enable us to get better, higher functioning teams put together? Please, tell me your DevOps stories.</description>

      <description>I wrote a little while back about using Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs with R to first of all detect the language of pieces of text and then do sentiment analysis on them. I wasn&amp;#8217;t too happy with the some of the code as it was very inelegant. I knew I could code better than I had, especially as I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot more work with purrr recently. However, it had sat in drafts for a while.</description>

      <title>Versioning R model objects in SQL Server</title>

      <description>High-level info If you build a model and never update it you&amp;#8217;re missing a trick. Behaviours change so your model will tend to perform worse over time. You&amp;#8217;ve got to regularly refresh it, whether that&amp;#8217;s adjusting the existing model to fit the latest data (recalibration) or building a whole new model (retraining), but this means you&amp;#8217;ve got new versions of your model that you have to handle. You need to think about your methodology for versioning R model objects, ideally before you lose any versions.</description>

      <description>Last week, I blogged about building a no-code Q&amp;amp;A bot for your website. One little niggle I had with the bot was the response when it could match a user input to a Q&amp;amp;A. I wondered how to change &amp;#8220;No match found!&amp;#8221;.
I looked around the qnamaker.ai site and couldn&amp;#8217;t find a place I could change this. I submitted some feedback and the great people at the other of the Q&amp;amp;A site responded super quickly.</description>

      <description>In this post, I describe the latest iteration of my automatic document production with R. It improves upon the methods used in Rtraining, and previous work on this topic can read by going to the auto deploying R documentation tag.
I keep banging on about this area because reproducible research / analytical document pipelines is an area I&amp;#8217;ve a keen interest in. I see it as a core part of DataOps as it&amp;#8217;s vital for helping us ensure our models and analysis are correct in data science and boosting our productivity.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to have a live chat option for their site but I&amp;#8217;m frequently away, so I wanted something that people could talk to interactively. This is a perfect scenario for a Q&amp;amp;A bot. Microsoft takes a ton of the pain out of Q&amp;amp;A bots, and it was much easier than I thought to get it added to my WordPress blog. Here is a how to do it for your site.</description>

      <description>Following my post about logistic regressions, Ryan got in touch about one bit of building logistic regressions models that I didn&amp;#8217;t cover in much detail &amp;#8211; interpreting&amp;nbsp;regression coefficients. This post will hopefully help Ryan (and others) out.
This was so helpful. Thank you! I&#39;d love to see more about interpreting the glm coefficients.  &amp;mdash; Ryan (@RyanEs) April 21, 2017  What is a coefficient? Coefficients are what a line of best fit model produces.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: parameter re-use within rmarkdown YAML</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-parameter-re-use-within-rmarkdown-yaml/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-parameter-re-use-within-rmarkdown-yaml/</guid>
      <description>Ever wondered how to make an rmarkdown title dynamic? Maybe, wanted to use a parameter in multiple locations? Maybe wanted to pass through a publication date? Advanced use of YAML headers can help!
Normally, when we write rmarkdown, we might use something like the basic YAML header that the rmarkdown template gives us.
--- title: &amp;quot;My report&amp;quot; date: &amp;quot;18th April, 2017&amp;quot; output: pdf_document ---  You may already know the trick about making the date dynamic to whatever date the report gets rendered on by using the inline R execution mode of rmarkdown to insert a value.</description>

      <description>A new version of HIBPwned has been accepted onto CRAN. This occurred yesterday so it could still be filtering into some mirrors.
HIBPwned is an R wrapper for the useful website HaveIBeenPwned and if you don&amp;#8217;t already utilise the package or the site &amp;#8211; you should. HaveIBeenPwned tells you when your details are included in data breaches. This is vital information to get quickly as it means you can sooner protect yourself from people trying to use the breach information to break into your accounts.</description>

https://t.co/WuyU9D6npK  &amp;mdash; Richie Cotton (@richierocks) May 1, 2017  It turns out awesome folks, George and Justin, had made a process whereby they can generate different distributions of points that retain the same summary statistics. They used this process for making some friends for Dino the Datasaurus who was created by Alberto Cairo. They made the data for Dino and the rest of the Datasaurus Dozen available for download.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: Upload multiple files in shiny and consolidate into a dataset</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-upload-multiple-files-in-shiny-and-consolidate-into-a-dataset/</link>

      <description>In shiny, you can use the fileInput with the parameter multiple = TRUE to enable you to upload multiple files at once. But how do you process those multiple files in shiny and consolidate into a single dataset?
The bit we need from shiny is the input$param$fileinputpath value.
We can use lapply() with data.table&amp;#8216;s fread() to read multiple CSVs from the fileInput(). Then to consolidate the data, we can use data.</description>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/building-an-r-training-environment/</guid>
      <description>I recently delivered a day of training at SQLBits and I really upped my game in terms of infrastructure for it. The resultant solution was super smooth and mitigated all the install issues and preparation for attendees. This meant we got to spend the whole day doing R, instead of troubleshooting.
I&amp;#8217;m so happy with the solution for an online R training environment that I want to share the solution, so you can take it and use it for when you need to do training.</description>

      <title>Logistic regressions (in R)</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/logistic-regressions-in-r/</guid>
      <description>Logistic regressions are a great tool for predicting outcomes that are categorical. They use a transformation function based on probability to perform a linear regression. This makes them easy to interpret and implement in other systems.
Logistic regressions can be used to perform a classification for things like determining whether someone needs to go for a biopsy. They can also be used for a more nuanced view by using the probabilities of an outcome for thinks like prioritising interventions based on likelihood to default on a loan.</description>

      <title>R Quick Tip: Table parameters for rmarkdown reports</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-table-parameters-for-rmarkdown-reports/</guid>
      <description>The recent(ish) advent of parameters in rmarkdown reports is pretty nifty but there&amp;#8217;s a little bit of behaviour that can come in handy but doesn&amp;#8217;t come across in the documentation. You can use table parameters for rmarkdown reports.
Previously, if you wanted to produce multiple reports based off a dataset, you would make the dataset available and then perform filtering in the report. Now we can pass the filtered data directly to the report, which keeps all the filtering logic in one place.</description>

May 19th &amp;#8211; Data science project in a day We&amp;#8217;ll be in Kiev, Ukraine, doing a whole data science project in a day. This is intended to give people a little bit of code, process, and critical thinking along the whole data science workflow. This will enable folks to see how it hangs together and decide where and how much they want to invest their learning in future.</description>

      <description>A fortnight ago I wrote&amp;nbsp;Dear South Wales &amp;amp; Bristol readers: I need your help&amp;nbsp;as Battle of the Beards was failing. Well, we didn&amp;#8217;t manage to make it to the minimum amount of attendees to go forward with it and on Thursday it looked like I was going to have to cancel it.
Then inspiration struck &amp;#8230; the major reasons why maybe people didn&amp;#8217;t want to attend are:
 Too far to travel Hard to get a day off work Not interested in all the talks  What would make it so people didn&amp;#8217;t have to travel, could watch from work, and see only the sessions they&amp;#8217;re interested in?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle of the Beards is an annual tech event in Cardiff that&amp;#8217;s previously been an evening affair but is now a day-long conference. We&amp;#8217;re hosting half-hour talks on security, infrastructure, software craftmanship, front-end development, and data visualisation. We&amp;#8217;re starting out the day with bacon baps and it just gets better from there. Tickets cost £15 and there&amp;#8217;s the option to add a donation to the charity we&amp;#8217;re supporting with the event, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thecalmzone.net/&#34;&gt;Campaign Against Living Miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ticket sales are really low and without your help, we&amp;#8217;ll have to cancel the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping you can help make this event succeed by doing one or both of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&#34;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if it&amp;#8217;s of interest to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommend it to others&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today in class, I taught some fundamentals of API consumption in R. As it was aligned to some Microsoft content, we first used &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s API and then played with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/&#34;&gt;Microsoft Cognitive Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216; Text Analytics API. This brief post overviews what you need to get started, and how you can chain consecutive calls to these APIs in order to perform multi-lingual sentiment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: See improved code in &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/using-purrr-with-apis/&#34;&gt;Using purrr with APIs – revamping my code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big part of why I&amp;#8217;ve launched Locke Data is so that I can give back more to my communities. I want to give more time and more support to others. One of the first steps is doing some activities that give financial support to community groups without damaging my startup cashflow! Community R workshops that fund local user groups is the first activity I&amp;#8217;ll be trialling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s involved, and what you might want to consider if you&amp;#8217;d like to be a part of this endeavour:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>One of the nifty things about using R is that you can use it for many different purposes and even other languages!
If you want to use Python in your knitr docs or the newish RStudio R notebook functionality, you might encounter some fiddliness getting all the moving parts running on Windows. This is a quick knitr Python Windows setup checklist to make sure you don&amp;#8217;t miss any important steps.</description>

      <title>Is my time series additive or multiplicative?</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/is-my-time-series-additive-or-multiplicative/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/is-my-time-series-additive-or-multiplicative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time series data is an important area of analysis, especially if you do a lot of web analytics. To be able to analyse time series effectively, it helps to understand the interaction between general seasonality in activity and the underlying trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactions between trend and seasonality are typically classified as either additive or multiplicative. This post looks at how we can classify a given time series as one or the other to facilitate further processing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRISP-DM and why you should know about it</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) was a concept developed 20 years ago now. I&amp;#8217;ve read about it in various data mining and related books and it&amp;#8217;s come in very handy over the years. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll outline what the model is and why you should know about it, even if it has that terribly out of vogue phrase data mining in it! 😉&lt;/p&gt;

    Data / R people. Do you know what the CRISP-DM model is?

      <description>The year has started out on a high for me. I&amp;#8217;ve handed in my notice Censornet and I was re-awarded the Data Platform MVP award by Microsoft. I handed in my notice not to go to a new job but to fly solo!
I&amp;#8217;m starting Locke Data in February to help people embed data science skills in their organisations.
Business intelligence has been a thing long enough that there&amp;#8217;s a whole department of people dedicated to it and it generally isn&amp;#8217;t disruptive to other areas of the business and IT.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I started my Stumbling Into series. I started but only got one in &amp;#8211; I was gonna talk about how I failed with Azure Functions next. I was failing because the docs outside C# (and node.js) were so limited that I found it difficult to get things done. However, I persevered and overcame a little bit of C#-ophobia and I can honestly say it has been so worth it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been writing (not enough) blog posts for a while now and have built up some neat stuff in the backlog if I may so myself. Alas, a lot of this doesn&amp;#8217;t get seen because it&amp;#8217;s not on the front page or in the top 5 blog posts. Sad that posts like my one on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/anchor-modelling-sixth-normal-form-databases/&#34;&gt;sixth normal form databases&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#8217;t get enough love, I&amp;#8217;ve installed the WordPress plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/tweet-old-post/&#34;&gt;Revive Old Posts&lt;/a&gt; (ROP) to try countering this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I had the tremendous pleasure of going to the Microsoft MVP Summit this week and it was a fantastic experience. It also taught me a valuable lesson &amp;#8211; I need to be an attendee more.
Microsoft award ~4,000 people their Most Valued Professional (MVP) award each year. MVPs are influential, helpful people who work with Microsoft services. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I did to get in when so many awesome folks I know haven&amp;#8217;t but I&amp;#8217;m very proud to be in receipt of the Award.</description>

      <description>This is a T-SQL Tuesday Post in response to Andy Bek&amp;#8217;s kick off about growing new speakers. You can write your own advice for new speakers, or blog your journey to speaking.
 I&amp;#8217;m always trying to encourage new speakers and the biggest fear I hear is &amp;#8220;I won&amp;#8217;t be any good at it&amp;#8221;. Well, you won&amp;#8217;t be perfect at it, that&amp;#8217;s for sure. You may start off really bad at it.</description>

      <title>Quick tip: Passing values to a bash script</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/quick-tip-passing-values-to-a-bash-script/</guid>
      <description>This is a very quick post on how you can make a bash script that allows you to provide it values via the command line. Passing values to a bash script uses a 1-based array convention inside the script, that are referenced by prefixing with $ inside the script.
This means that if I provide .\dummyscript.sh value1 value2, inside the dummyscript.sh I can retrieve these by referencing their positions:
echo $1 + $2  For improved clarity, you could assign them to new variables</description>

      <description>Ok, this post is about one of my latest crazy/harebrained/whacky ideas.
I&amp;#8217;m fed up of having to carry my Galaxy Note 3 in my hand. I can&amp;#8217;t stand handbags and most women&amp;#8217;s clothing items don&amp;#8217;t have pockets or the pockets are insufficient. Given how easy it is to build a website these days, I thought I&amp;#8217;d become a sofa warrior for the campaign for pockets. I&amp;#8217;ve made a site and aim to make it an open &amp;amp; technical backend.</description>

      <title>5 useful CSS sites</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of web development recently, primarily via the magical Hugo platform. Between it and the great themes for it, it&amp;#8217;s making website building fairly painless. Of course, each theme often needs customising to the relevant brand a given site is for. That customising is usually just one by some fonts and by tweaking the CSS.*
I&amp;#8217;ve been relying on some old, and some very new, funky tools to help with CSS hacking and I thought I would share them, in case they should prove useful to you in the future.</description>

      <description>Slack all the things! OK, if you haven&amp;#8217;t heard of it before Slack is kinda like IRC, kinda like Dropbox, kinda like a lot of things &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a neat place to bring together communications between your team or community, and the integrations allow you to pipe in external feeds like twitter activity or RSS. It&amp;#8217;s a great way of collaborating online and I&amp;#8217;ve found it especially useful not just within a company but within a global community.</description>

      <description>Some folks may already know, but I handed in my resignation from SQL Relay as sponsorship lead and Cardiff organiser.
Over my time in SQL Relay, I&amp;#8217;ve helped deliver 30 conferences. I&amp;#8217;ve attended about 15 of those! Being able to deliver so much learning to people all around the country has been an incredible experience and I&amp;#8217;m tremendously proud of everything SQL Relay has achieved.
However, SQL Relay has become increasingly difficult for me to dedicate the time to.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will give you a quick run-through of adding tSQLt to an existing database project destined for Azure SQL DB. This basically covers unit testing in SSDT and there is a lot of excellent info out there, so this focuses on getting you through the initial setup as quickly as possible. This post most especially relies on the information &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilesql.club/&#34;&gt;Ed Elliot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kzhendev.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Ken Ross&lt;/a&gt; have published, so do check them out for more info on this topic!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s PASS Board of Directors elections again! After a number of twitter discussions last week about the applicability of PASS outside of the US and what I think PASS is good and bad at, I thought I would engage the process instead of just being a complainy-pants. I attended all 6 town hall webinars and asked questions to all the candidates. I recommend you watch them before voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about the candidates, the PASS Board of Director elections, and how to vote on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlpass.org/Elections&#34;&gt;PASS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All my energy left over from my major work project has been going into SQL Relay. SQL Relay is an ambitious project every year. We organise a conference that goes on tour. In previous years, I&amp;#8217;ve gone to 8 cities over two weeks. Over the past 4 years, I&amp;#8217;ve been part of organising 30 conferences.</description>

      <description>Getting started with GameMaker, making Asteroids! I mean OK, it&amp;#8217;s just a clone of a classic, but isn&amp;#8217;t that how fledgling artists practice? Initially created following a tutorial, I then went through and added a lot of extra features, including music, splash screens, a pause function and much cleaner code.
Embedding by i-frame is pretty ugly, so please follow the link below to try the game.

      <description>Haveibeenpwned.com is a fantastic service that helps people find out if they&amp;#8217;ve been involved in a data breach. HIBPwned is an R wrapper for that service.
Recently, due to abuse of the system, Troy Hunt had to add a limit of one request per 1.5s.
The new version published on CRAN last night adds a delay into each call so that we can continue to use it in R.

      <description>Sponsorship Basics is the first installment of the Sponsoring Community Events series aimed at helping companies get to grips with sponsoring community events, and getting the most out of them.
What is a community event? A community event is one organised by members of the community, as opposed to one run by one or more companies with a financial interest in the community. These events are fundamentally different because they are not being run for profit, instead, they&amp;#8217;re run to assist other members of the community to increase their skills.</description>

      <description>Sponsoring community events &amp;#8211; is it right for you? This series of posts will take you through the things you need to know to help you decide.
Over the coming weeks, this new series will go through the in&amp;#8217;s and out&amp;#8217;s of sponsoring community events. Community events are fantastic from an attendee perspective, but when you&amp;#8217;re handing over cash you need to know what you&amp;#8217;re letting yourself in for and how you get return on investment (ROI).</description>

      <title>Giving back with code</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/giving-back-with-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From code in answers on Stack Overflow to R packages or full programs, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of code being written and given away. This post examines some of the reasons why the people writing all that code do it, why you should consider giving back with code, and how you can get started. Finally, I cap it all off with perspectives from some of my favourite coders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#getstarted&#34;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives&#34;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why you should consider writing code and making it available for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;altruistic&#34;&gt;Altruistic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re writing something to achieve a task, odds are someone else would have to write the same code &amp;#8211; why not help them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;re using a lot of open source software, whether you realise it or not. By open sourcing your code, you get to pay it forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give others something to contribute to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown quantities are risky hires, put your code out there for the world to see and employers get to see what you can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop your skills for the next job, the one that requires you to be more skilled in something than you are now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to interact with a lot of different people who you build credibility with, and hopefully friendships!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-oneself&#34;&gt;For oneself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, the more code you write, the better your coding skills so if you want to improve your skills this is an ideal way to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the sheer fun of doing cool stuff, especially if you don&amp;#8217;t get to do cool stuff in the day job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do it &amp;#8220;the way it should be done&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Ideas for (lightning) talks</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m trying to encourage more lightning talks at my user groups, and I started by writing a plea to folks at my local R user group, caRdiff. In it I included some ideas for lightning talks, and of course, these can be used as the basis for long talks too. We had some fun batting this list around and expanding it in the Cardiff dev group. I thought it was worth sharing, and getting some more ideas from you!</description>

      <title>Stumbling into … Azure Automation</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/stumbling-into--azure-automation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 09:46:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/stumbling-into--azure-automation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently been trying to solve the challenge of working extracting files from AWS and getting them into Azure in my desired format. I wanted a solution that kept everything on the cloud and completely avoid local tin. I wanted it to have built-in auditing and error handling. I wanted something whizzy and new, to be honest! One way in which I attempted to tackle the task was with &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/automation/&#34;&gt;Azure Automation&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll overview Automation and explore how it stacked up for what I was attempting to use it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Task: Get compressed (.tar.gz) files from AWS S3 to Azure, decompress the files, concatenate the contents and put in a different container for analytics magic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with most things I dropped myself into the deep-end on it so had fairly minimal knowledge of PowerShell and the Azure modules, therefore I fully expect more knowledgeable folks to wince at my stuff. General advice, &amp;#8220;you should do it like this, then this&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&amp;#8216;s, and resource recommendations are all very welcome &amp;#8211; leave a comment with them in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;azure-automation&#34;&gt;Azure Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Automation is essentially a hosted PowerShell script execution service. It seems to be aimed primarily at managing Azure resources, particularly via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/powershell-desired-state-configuration-the-basics/&#34;&gt;Desired State Configurations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, a general PowerShell powerhouse, with scheduling capabilities and a bunch of useful features for the safe storage of credentials etc. This makes it an excellent tool if you&amp;#8217;re looking to do something with PowerShell on a regular basis and need to interact with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I love user groups and I always want there to be more. I&amp;#8217;m not a perfect organiser but I run reasonable groups. When I see organisers doing it badly, it makes me sad. There&amp;#8217;s lots of great ways to run a user group, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d cover some of the bad ways to run a user group. The anti-patterns if you will 😀

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think of myself as an expert because an expert is someone with very deep knowledge of a comparatively narrow field.
For better or worse, a lot of my sense of satisfaction with life derives from throwing myself into some enterprise that I don&amp;#8217;t have the people skills, the knowledge, and/or the resources for succeeding. I welcome the failures, the dead ends, the crises of faith, because if it wasn&amp;#8217;t hard it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be worth doing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked the way Brent showed us &lt;a href=&#34;https://ozar.me/2016/06/feedback-on-my-sqlpass-summit16-abstract-submissions/&#34;&gt;his feedback received&lt;/a&gt; and since mimicry is the best form of flattery, I thought I&amp;#8217;d go ahead and do it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t get any accepted abstracts, and I&amp;#8217;m actually grateful. The recent stresses to do with the PASS dramas aside, I would have had to use 5 days holiday time, pay for flights and hotel, and then flown out a week later for MVP Summit. Now I can attend some other conferences and/or have a Christmas break! Woo hoo 😀&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In R, we can use a file called .Rprofile to do things in R based on a number of triggers. One thing I&amp;#8217;ve done is give myself a DIY notification of how many data breaches I&amp;#8217;ve been involved in!
First of all, you need a file called .Rprofile that&amp;#8217;s stored in your working directory. Some useful resources about .Rprofiles can be found on .Rprofile CRAN docs and an .Rprofile intro.</description>

      <title>Azure Storage Accounts – Resource Groups matter to PowerShell!</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m sure that all my PoSh friends out there, who use Azure and PowerShell all the time probably know this already but I thought I&amp;#8217;d share a little snippet of hard-won knowledge.
 When you put an Azure Storage Account into a Resource Group, you can no longer use the default Azure.Storage module. Instead, you&amp;#8217;ve got to use the AzureRM.Storage module.
 All the scripts I encountered whilst googling how to connect to blob storage via PowerShell, including the ones in the script gallery within Azure Automation seemed to all assume the azure storage account you wanted to connect to was standalone.</description>

      <description>Part of my (slowly) working pipeline of coding projects has been an R package that wraps the fantastic HaveIBeenPwned.com API.
If you&amp;#8217;re not already familiar with HaveIBeenPwned, rectify the situation, NOW! Don&amp;#8217;t worry about continuing to read the rest of the post; getting yourself signed up for account breach notifications is way more important!Go now!
/giphy run
With that stern admonishment out of the way&amp;#8230;
HIBPwned is a feature complete R package that allows you to use every (currently) available endpoint of the API.</description>

      <description>Voting for 2 of the 3 locations for satRday conferences will be closing at the end of May 31st (GMT). It&amp;#8217;s been a phenomenal turnout with more than 1,500 votes so far.
You can still vote if you haven&amp;#8217;t already!
EU status Budapest, Hungary, is where Gergely will be throwing the EU event and it&amp;#8217;s tentatively set for September.
US status Chicago started out with a close runner of Washington DC, but that all changed as folks realised they could visit Puerto Rico and get fantastic learning, or Puerto Rico has for more R people than my tenuous grasp of geography led me to expect.</description>

      <description>satRdays, free R conferences, are a project being supported by the R Consortium. When Gergely and I submitted our proposal, we said we&amp;#8217;d be supporting three conferences:
 Budapest, Hungary (Gergely&amp;#8217;s home turf) Somewhere in the US Somewhere else in the world  We&amp;#8217;ve had an overwhelming response with 40 submitted conferences but for the fully-funded ones, there can only be three. We are looking at how the runners up can do the next wave of events but we want to get the ball rolling on the first three.</description>

      <title>Installing SQL Server ODBC drivers on Ubuntu 15.04</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/installing-sql-server-odbc-drivers-on-ubuntu-15.04/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 14:13:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/installing-sql-server-odbc-drivers-on-ubuntu-15.04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2016-10-21 : You can now get the ODBC 13 driver for Linux with a much smoother install process than below. Get all the relevant information on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2016/10/20/odbc-driver-13-0-for-linux-released/&#34;&gt;the announcement from the Microsoft SQLNCli team blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can now get &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/server-cloud/sql-server-on-linux.aspx&#34;&gt;SQL Server ODBC drivers for Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, no, maybe? It&amp;#8217;s ok even if you haven&amp;#8217;t since it&amp;#8217;s pretty new! Anyway, this presents me with an ideal opportunity to standardise my SQL Server ODBC connections across the operating systems I use R on i.e. Windows and Ubuntu. My first trial was to get it working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; since that&amp;#8217;s where all my training magic happens and if it can&amp;#8217;t work on a clean build like Travis, then where can it work? Alas, the ODBC 13 driver doesn&amp;#8217;t work Ubuntu 14.04 so this set of instructions has been modified to provide code for Ubuntu 15.04 only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works, but it&amp;#8217;s really hacky right now. Definitely looking forward to the next iterations of this driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will work for Ubuntu 15.04 but 14.04 has a different set of C compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is currently hacky, and Microsoft are on the case for improving it so this post could quickly become out of date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very careful installing the driver on an existing machine. Due to the overwriting of unixODBC if already installed and potential compatibility issues with other driver managers you may have installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Shiny module design patterns: Pass module inputs to other modules</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing in the series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/tag/shiny-design-patterns/&#34;&gt;shiny module design patterns&lt;/a&gt;, this post covers how to pass all the inputs from one module to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; from within the server call. Store the &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt; result in a variable. Pass the variable into arguments for other modules. Access the variable like you would &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/shiny-module-design-pattern-pass-inputs-one-module-another/&#34;&gt;shiny modules design pattern of passing an input value to many modules&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m now going to look at a more complex shiny module design pattern: passing an input from one module to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return the input in a reactive expression from within the server call. Store the &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt; result in a variable. Pass the variable into arguments for other modules. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Travis? Make sure you use a Github PAT</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/using-travis-make-sure-you-use-a-github-pat/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2016 10:27:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/using-travis-make-sure-you-use-a-github-pat/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in the fantastic situation where lots of people are using &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; to test their R packages or use it to test and deploy their analytics/ documentation / anything really. It&amp;#8217;s popularity has been having a negative side-effect recently though! GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting&#34;&gt;rate limits&lt;/a&gt; API access to 5000 requests per hour so sometimes there are more R related jobs running on Travis per hour than this limit, causing builds to error typically with a message that includes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;403 forbidden&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This error will cause your build to fail, even if you didn&amp;#8217;t do anything wrong. To solve it short-term you can wait a little while and restart your build.&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_61598&#34; style=&#34;width: 768px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium_large wp-image-61598&#34; src=&#34;http://res.cloudinary.com/lockedata/image/upload/h_131,w_750/v1499850336/restartbuilds_hsvpmp.png&#34; alt=&#34;How to restart a build in Travis-CI&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;134&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;How to restart a build in Travis-CI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a very short-termist solution and does not solve the problem for future you or other users of the service. The real solution to resolving this issue is to get off the default API access credentials and use your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The R integration in Travis makes good use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools&#34;&gt;devtools&lt;/a&gt;. The devtools package looks for an environment variable called &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_PAT&lt;/code&gt; that holds a &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/&#34;&gt;personal access token&lt;/a&gt; (PAT) for using the GitHub API and if it doesn&amp;#8217;t find one it uses a default token. When we get our own PAT and store it in Travis, devtools will pick up our token and use it, meaning you&amp;#8217;ll only ever get rate limited if you do more than 5000 builds in an hour, which is an achievement I&amp;#8217;d love to hear about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/shiny-developer-conference-registration-19153967031&#34;&gt;Shiny Developers Conference&lt;/a&gt; back in January, I endeavoured to learn about shiny modules and &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/declutter-a-shiny-reports-code-v2-0/&#34;&gt;overhaul an application&lt;/a&gt; using them in the space of two days. I succeeded and almost immediately switched onto other projects, thereby losing most of the hard-won knowledge! As I rediscover shiny modules and start putting them into more active use, I&amp;#8217;ll be blogging about design patterns. This post takes you through the case of multiple modules receiving the same input value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick overall config input objects at the app level and pass them in a reactive expression to &lt;code&gt;callModule()&lt;/code&gt;. Pass the results in as an extra argument into subsequent modules. These are reactive so don&amp;#8217;t forget the brackets. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/shinymodulesdesignpatterns&#34;&gt;Steal the code&lt;/a&gt; and, as always, if you can improve it do so!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R Quick Tip: Collapse a lists of data.frames with data.table</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-collapse-a-lists-of-data.frames-with-data.table/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-quick-tip-collapse-a-lists-of-data.frames-with-data.table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/HIBPwned&#34;&gt;HIBPwned&lt;/a&gt; package, I consume the &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com/&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned&lt;/a&gt; API and return back a list object with an element for each email address. Each element holds a data.frame of breach data or a stub response with a single column data.frame containing NA. Elements are named with the email addresses they relate to. I had a list of data.frames and I wanted a consolidated data.frame (well, I always want a data.table).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter data.table &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table&#34;&gt;data.table&lt;/a&gt; has a very cool, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15673550/why-is-rbindlist-better-than-rbind&#34;&gt;very fast&lt;/a&gt; function named &lt;code&gt;rbindlist()&lt;/code&gt;. This takes a list of data.frames and consolidates them into one data.table, which can, of course, be handled as a data.frame if you didn&amp;#8217;t want to use data.table for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Auto-deploying documentation: better change tracking of artefacts</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/auto-deploying-documentation-better-change-tracking-of-artefacts/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 11:04:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/auto-deploying-documentation-better-change-tracking-of-artefacts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my never-ending quest to deploy documentation better, I&amp;#8217;ve made yet another tweak to my scripts that deploy R vignettes or Rmarkdown documents to the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch of my github repositories via Travis-CI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script from &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/11/travis_ci_gh_pages.html&#34;&gt;Robert Flight&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;#8217;s provided the basis for most of this work does something specific to update the web facing branch of the repository. It would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a blank repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the requisite files to the repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add and commit them to the repo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Force the repo to overwrite the &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This had the unfortunate consequence of losing the history of what was previously hosted on the branch and could not tell me what commit to my development branches was responsible for a version of the docs. It took a little bit of playing but the revised script now:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clones the gh-pages branch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds the requisite files into the reports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add and commit them to the repo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Push the changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an environment variable ($TRAVIS_COMMIT) the commit message is the commit ID for the latest commit in the build that occurs on Travis, making it very easy to see what changes triggered a documentation update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is a brief update on my packages not currently on CRAN: tfsR, HIBPwned, and mockaRoo.
tfsR tfsR is designed to help you work git repositories in Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). I wrote the package a while ago and it has/had just two functions; one for getting a list of git repositories, and one for making a new git repository. The release of httr 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m very pleased to say that the R Consortium agreed to the support the satRday project!
The idea kicked off in November and I was over the moon with the response from the community, then we garnered support before submitting to the Consortium and I must have looped the moon a few times as we had more than 500 responses. Now the R Consortium are supporting us and we can turn all that enthusiasm into action.</description>

      <title>HIBPwned, an R package for HaveIBeenPwned.com</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/hibpwned-an-r-package-for-haveibeenpwned.com/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/hibpwned-an-r-package-for-haveibeenpwned.com/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The answer in life to the inevitable question of &amp;#8220;How can I do that in R?&amp;#8221; should be &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a package for that&amp;#8221;. So when I wanted to query &lt;a href=&#34;https://haveibeenpwned.com&#34;&gt;HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/a&gt; (HIBP) to check whether a bunch of emails had been involved in data breaches and there wasn&amp;#8217;t an R package for HIBP, it meant that the responsibility for making one landed on my shoulders. Now, you can see if your accounts are at risk with the R package for HaveIBeenPwned.com, &lt;strong&gt;HIBPwned&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_61581&#34; style=&#34;width: 768px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption alignnone&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://res.cloudinary.com/lockedata/image/upload/h_139,w_750/v1499850337/hibp_os8t5d.png&#34; alt=&#34;Have I Been Pwned | HaveIBeenPwned.com&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;142&#34; class=&#34;size-medium_large wp-image-61581&#34; /&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;Have I Been Pwned | HaveIBeenPwned.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current status&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is currently available on github @ &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/HIBPwned&#34;&gt;stephlocke/HIBPwned&lt;/a&gt;, but I intend to submit to CRAN after getting some feedback from y&amp;#8217;all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Just a quick heads up to peeps in and around Cardiff, Wales. Later this month we&amp;#8217;re holding Battle of the Beards: Return of the Beard. Fantastic speakers with resplendent beards are joining us for our 6 sq. ft of pizza to present on advanced SQL Tricks, using PowerBI as a DBA, and stepping up to the challenge of the last minute audit.
This is a great chance to meet folks interested in the Microsoft Data Platform and learn from some incredibly knowledgable speakers.</description>

      <title>SSH tunnels on Windows for R</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/ssh-tunnels-on-windows-for-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve had to get to grips with SSH tunnels. SSH tunnels are really useful for maintaining remote network integrity and work in a secure fashion. It is, however, a pain to open PuTTY and log in all the time, mainly because I couldn&amp;#8217;t script it in R! It&amp;#8217;s been a trial, but like most things it turned out to be pretty simple in the end so I thought I&amp;#8217;d share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-8217-s-required&#34;&gt;What&amp;#8217;s required?&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>Just a heads-up for people like me who&amp;#8217;ve gotten a Windows 10 machine and have used Edge as a PDF reader. I was too lazy to install Adobe Reader and was instead using Edge as my default reader. This gave me a mini-heart attack when I received a proof for my super cool NFC-tag laptop stickers and the colour was wrong. WTF right, I mean we did send it as CMYK and all that jazz so it should be right, a printer wouldn&amp;#8217;t screw that up, right?</description>

      <title>mockaRoo – making realistic test data in R</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/mockaroo--making-realistic-test-data-in-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 14:00:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/mockaroo--making-realistic-test-data-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m building stuff in R like packages, models, etc. I find myself wishing for realistic looking test data without having to resort to getting data off my production server. To that end I&amp;#8217;ve been on the hunt for a way of generating decent test data. A few months back I stumbled upon the neat system &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mockaroo.com/&#34;&gt;Mockaroo&lt;/a&gt; which provides a GUI to build some data that suits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mockaroo is a really impressive service with a wide spread of different data types. They also have simple ways of adding things like within group differences to data so that you can mock realistic class differences. They use the freemium model so you can get a thousand rows per download, which is pretty sweet. The big BUT you can feel coming on is this &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a GUI! I don&amp;#8217;t want to have spend time hand cranking a data extract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, they have a GUI for getting data too and it&amp;#8217;s pretty simply to use so I&amp;#8217;ve started making a package for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started the package on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/mockaRoo&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and will be developing it over the next month or two. It&amp;#8217;s up and working, but only in the most primitive way as I&amp;#8217;d like to get some feedback from folks who might find this useful around how the interface for generating your desired data schema should work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In May, I will be delivering two R for Microsoft training days. These two days will focus on some R fundamentals and applying these fundamentals within the Microsoft Data Platform. These training days are ideal if you know one half of the components &amp;#8211; whether that&amp;#8217;s the R bit or the Microsoft BI bit. Either way, you&amp;#8217;ll learn about the other half.
SQLBits SQLBits XV is being held in Liverpool this year and my training day is on May 4th.</description>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/declutter-a-shiny-reports-code-v2.0/</guid>
      <description>I wrote a year ago on a way to declutter shiny report code which involved putting objects into a sourced file, however, at that point in time the solution was a bit brittle and clunky. Now there&amp;#8217;s a better way to develop shiny applications &amp;#8211; shiny modules.
In October, RStudio introduced the concept of modules which involves abstracting code out into self-contained blocks.
Modules are ways of batching your code into discrete chunks &amp;#8211; you keep all the code related to the inputs, manipulation, and presentation for doing something in one module.</description>

That was on top of SQL Relay, copious presentations, and much travelling. By the end of the year I was pretty ill and exceedingly grumpy.

&lt;p&gt;I love my Dell XPS13. It&amp;#8217;s fast, sleek and gorgeous. It does however have one little problem: the icon and text size. The text was always too big for the buttons and boxes and the icons were so small you could hardly see them. This made it hard to use my machine without an external screen (which doesn&amp;#8217;t have that issue and should have been my first clue!)&lt;figure id=&#34;attachment_61507&#34; style=&#34;width: 2062px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 A name: satRday A proposition: Free/cheap (&amp;lt;£30) conferences organised by user groups around the world. Attendees get more access to training in R, with a much lower cost-barrier. We develop more speakers on R.</description>

      <description>About Anchor Modelling Anchor Modelling moves you beyond third normal form and into sixth normal form. What does this mean?
 Not sure about the normal forms? See the normalization process in actions with this normalisation example
 Essentially it means that an attribute is stored independently against the key, not in a big table with other attributes. This means you can easily store metadata about that attribute and do full change tracking with ease.</description>

      <description>In my last post on using GitHub, Travis-CI, and rmarkdown/knitr for automatically building and deploying documentation, I covered how I was able to do it with a containerised approach so things were faster. I also said my Rtraining repository was still too brittle to blog about. This has changed &amp;#8211; WOO HOO!
The main thanks for that goes out to the new package ezknitr from Dean Attali. ezknitr takes the pain out of working directories, making my hierarchies much more resilient.</description>

      <description>I recently did something for the first time: I declined to speak somewhere. It was never stated on the submission page, and was raised only after my session was accepted &amp;#8211; they wanted me to buy a ticket to attend and I refused&amp;nbsp;to do that.
As a speaker I love donating my time and I really don&amp;#8217;t mind paying my own&amp;nbsp;Travel and Expenses (T&amp;amp;E) but to have to pay to get in the door of the place I&amp;#8217;m speaking at feels wrong.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://borishristov.com/&#34;&gt;Boris Hristrov&lt;/a&gt;, Data Platform MVP, design whizz, and all-round great guy, recently launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.356labs.com/&#34;&gt;356labs&lt;/a&gt;. Boris wrote a great &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/presentation-design-introduction&#34;&gt;Presentation Design course&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://preview.pluralsight.com/&#34;&gt;PluralSight&lt;/a&gt;, you can sign up for a trial of PluralSight and watch the course if you&amp;#8217;d like to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an avid reader of design stuff I did find I knew some of the things on the course, but the context and application were very helpful. Off the back of his course, I went on to produce my most visually impressive presentation slide deck to date &amp;#8211; Agile BI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a look over his site and asked a few questions since I was really curious. Here are the responses!&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/optirum-0.37.1-now-out/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/optirum-gini-like-a-wizard/&#34;&gt;wrote about how I was waiting&lt;/a&gt; to be able to release &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/optiRum&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt; to CRAN, well data.table 1.9.6 was released (a key dependency for new functionality) and I&amp;#8217;ve finally had some quiet time. So optiRum 1.37.1 is now accepted and trickling through the CRAN publish processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQLSaturdays but for R?</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 19:25:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Proposal now being developed after fantastic community support. Check out satRdays on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and contribute your opinions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a contact from a very nice chap in Dallas a month ago about whether in the R world we do anything like SQLSaturdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the SQLSaturdays he said was not that they&amp;#8217;re free (well it helps!) but that they&amp;#8217;re on his time. Developing his skills was something he couldn&amp;#8217;t get signed off by his boss so he wanted to be able to do it by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to the question of whether there are local(ish) weekend conferences happening regularly for R, my answer was &amp;#8220;not really&amp;#8221; and it&amp;#8217;s a shame because the R community is fantastic. I started thinking about why we don&amp;#8217;t have them and what would be needed to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free / cheap regional small-medium conferences are a must for growing user knowledge and speakers in R.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Since August, I&amp;#8217;ve had the pleasure to work at Mango Solutions, a data science consultancy, as a Principal Consultant.
In that time, I&amp;#8217;ve been to EARL London, SQL Relay, and SQL in the City, so conference season has been in full swing with more to come in the form EARL Boston next week. Surprisingly, I&amp;#8217;ve also found some time to help some customers out and write some blog posts over on the Mango site.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, another Women in Technology conference got forwarded around and looking at the agenda, I snapped. I asked to not see any more goddamn WiT conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really fed up with women talking about being in tech. I don&amp;#8217;t perceive any value in attending a conference dedicated to that. I want to see more women talking about doing tech.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I presented a &lt;a href=&#34;https://1drv.ms/p/s!AiZm2P6YHtSfjye0xDn_fuL80eSp&#34;&gt;lightning talk on DataOps&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlinthecity.red-gate.com/london-2015/&#34;&gt;SQL in the City&lt;/a&gt;. It was a fantastic day and a great opportunity to catch up with how the database side of things is evolving to embrace &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lightning talk was titled &lt;em&gt;DataOps &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a thing (honest)&lt;/em&gt; and focused on what is essentially DevOps ported out of the developer sphere and into the data professional sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>SQL Relay is back on tour! Our 6th event sees us yet again touring the country bringing awesome speakers to eight cities over 2 weeks.
As usual we&amp;#8217;re improving things:
 A new platform called Attendee.Events which allows easier registration &amp;amp; speaker submission A whole bunch of webinars planned to get in the swing of things More breadth &amp;#8211; this year each event includes a dedicated track to R, machine learning etc, on top of SQL Server and business intelligence More content &amp;#8211; instead of swapping out existing slots for breadth, we added more tracks A green initiative &amp;#8230; see it on the day Improved speaker experience &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re building on last year&amp;#8217;s fun bus with the help of SQL Sentry to make it easier and more fun for speakers to do multiple events, as well as offering first timers some mentoring as most of the organisers are also speakers  You&amp;#8217;ll see a lot of announcements about Relay over the next few months, but I hope this little post inspires you to check out our events 😀</description>

      <title>R training day mk2 – @SQLSatMcr</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-training-day-mk2--sqlsatmcr/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-training-day-mk2--sqlsatmcr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in April, for SQL Saturday Exeter I ran &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/sqlsaturday-exeter-2015/&#34;&gt;my first ever full day of training&lt;/a&gt;. Next month sees me taking my second tilt at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign up for my R training day, July 24th, in Manchester you can go to the pre-con homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I may say so myself, it&amp;#8217;s a steal at £99 but then they all are! For instance, Andrew Fryer&amp;#8217;s training day covers the Machine Learning use of R via Azure, so if you&amp;#8217;re already wrangling numbers like a pro in R, understanding how you can apply it to snazzy webservices is a great way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Custom LaTeX Beamer style templates for rmarkdown</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/custom-latex-beamer-style-templates-for-rmarkdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Jun 2015 12:34:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/custom-latex-beamer-style-templates-for-rmarkdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been producing presentations via R using &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt; and outputting to either ioslides or slidify. That was excellent, because I could provide a CSS that customised the look and feel (relatively) easily*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I wanted to produce a PDF version, I couldn&amp;#8217;t make ones that look as good as the pure LaTeX versions I could make on &lt;a href=&#34;http://overleaf.com&#34;&gt;overleaf.com&lt;/a&gt;. So I started RTFMing when I wanted to replicate the look and feel from my presentation, The LaTeX Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend a huge amount of time on it, so this little story of hack and slash may feel a bit dirty to you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from my post about the principles behind using travis-ci to commit to a &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; I wanted to follow-up with how I tackled my &amp;#8220;intermediate&amp;#8221; use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/&#34;&gt;my original post&lt;/a&gt; I show how I pushed the tfsR vignette to &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;, which involved copying it and renaming it to index.html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t work if I had multiple vignettes that I wanted to be accessible online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An index.html file&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A way of extracting any number of html files from the vignette folder&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Yesterday I had the pleasure of hanging out &amp;#8220;on air&amp;#8221; with Boris Hristov.
We talked open sourcing!
You can download and/or contribute to the following projects I have going:
 MeDriAnchor: the Metadata Driven Anchor model system. You get to have a lot of fun with 6NF! optiRum: a useful package for R, especially for the UK tfsR: for my own special brand of crazy, working with TFS git repositories in R  James Skipwith (the other major developer on MeDriAnchor) presented on automation and covers MeDriAnchor &amp;#8211; you can check it out at SQLBits.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optiRum/&#34; title=&#34;optiRum on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt;, the R package I built and support for Optimum on CRAN has gained some extra functions recently. Some of it uses currently experimental data.table functionality so I&amp;#8217;m eagerly awaiting the release to CRAN to deliver optiRum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some brief overviews of &lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; functionality contained in the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/optirum-gini-like-a-wizard/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the coverage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/optiRum&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt; functionality is to talk about the stuff that makes generating outputs easier!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automated documentation hosting on github via Travis-CI</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/automated-documentation-hosting-on-github-via-travis-ci/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to cover how you can use continuous integration and source control to build and host documentation (or any other static HTML) for free, and in a way that updates every time your code changes. I&amp;#8217;ll cover the generic capability, and then how I apply this to my simplest package, tfsR. In a later post (once I&amp;#8217;ve cracked the best method to do it) I&amp;#8217;ll cover my more complex use case of multiple documents and a dynamically constructed index page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: This is kicked off from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/11/travis_ci_gh_pages.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from Robert Flight about applying to the technique to R package vignettes. It&amp;#8217;s a very useful post but it was quite specific to his situation and I wanted to understand the principles behind it before I started extending it to my more complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must haves:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A linux machine (so you can test your bash script that Travis-CI will run)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R (for following the specific instructions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;high-level-process&#34;&gt;High-level process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get an OAUTH token from github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add OAUTH token to travis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a *.sh file that gets your HTML (depending on circumstance, you may also need to generate it) and pushes to gh-pages branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include your .sh file in the &lt;code&gt;after_success&lt;/code&gt; part of your travis file&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit &amp;amp; push!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The SQL Server community has a lot of events. In the UK alone this year we will have/had in 2015:
 more than 75 user group meetings 5 SQL Saturdays 8 days of Relay 1 SQL in the City 3 to 5 days of SQLBits possibly a SQL Santa and probably more that I&amp;#8217;ve forgotten or not know about at the time of writing this  You could attend 2 days of conference per month (cpm from now on) on average in the UK alone, just at dedicated SQL events.</description>

      <description>Well SQL Saturday Exeter flew by. T&amp;#8217;was great catching up with people, seeing folks learn how to use (old &amp;amp; new) tools better, and just generally watching everyone having a great time at one of the best organised conferences I have the pleasure of going to.
Here are links to all the slide decks etc that we presented this weekend:
 My R: analysis to integration training day notes &amp;amp; source code My agile BI slide deck My Shiny: dashboards in R slide deck &amp;amp; source code Oz&amp;#8217;s SSRS: Beyond the basics slide deck &amp;amp; source code  If you attended any of our sessions, give us some constructive criticism!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;excellent guidance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/&#34;&gt;tooling&lt;/a&gt; on making R packages, it&amp;#8217;s becoming really easy to make a package to hold your R functionality. This has a host of benefits, not least source control (via GitHub) and unit testing (via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;testthat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; package). Once you have a package and unit tests, a great way of making sure that as you change things you don&amp;#8217;t break them is to perform &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; time you make a change, your package is built and thoroughly checked for any issues. If issues are found the &amp;#8220;build&amp;#8217;s broke&amp;#8221; and you have to fix it ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest, cheapest, and fastest way of setting up continuous integration for R stuff is to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.com/&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt;, which is free if you use &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; as a remote server for your code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB &amp;#8211; it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be your only remote server&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I had the pleasure of presenting at unified.diff, a general programming user group in Cardiff, last night and was able to debut my LaTeX show!
If you&amp;#8217;d like to talk at the group about anything tech related tweet them on @unifiedDiff. They&amp;#8217;re very flexible on time and topic so if you&amp;#8217;re based in Cardiff or are coming down to see a client, it&amp;#8217;s an easy way of delivering a talk and meeting some nice people.</description>

      <title>optiRum – gini like a wizard</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/optirum--gini-like-a-wizard/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2015 10:22:38 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/optirum--gini-like-a-wizard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optiRum/&#34; title=&#34;optiRum on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;optiRum&lt;/a&gt;, the R package I built and maintain for Optimum on CRAN has gained some extra functions recently. Some of it uses currently experimental data.table functionality so I&amp;#8217;m eagerly awaiting the release to CRAN to deliver optiRum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interim, I thought I&amp;#8217;d give some brief overviews of &lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; functionality contained in the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of regression models and one of the common tools for assessing a regression&amp;#8217;s ability to accurately model an event is to produce a Gini chart and a Gini coefficient. The higher the Gini coefficient, the more your model is able to discriminate probability accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simplify the process of producing gini charts (&lt;code&gt;giniChart&lt;/code&gt;) and coefficients (&lt;code&gt;giniCoef&lt;/code&gt;) so that I get a chart in one simple step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the hood this uses the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AUC/&#34; title=&#34;AUC on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AUC&lt;/a&gt; package to get the coefficient, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scales/&#34; title=&#34;scales on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; to format it and &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/&#34; title=&#34;ggplot2 documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; to produce the chart. Using ggplot leads to a better looking chart that can also be tweaked to suit your needs since a ggplot object is returned by the function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A recurring problem with my presentations is font size.
 The inclusion of code in my Rmarkdown slides was by default too small. Upping the fontsize via CSS worked ok, but when I switched to a shiny app version for my intro to shiny, it reverted and I&amp;#8217;m afraid to say I didn&amp;#8217;t notice beforehand. I use PuTTY for showing how to do some stuff in the linux command line but the font&amp;#8217;s quite small by default and Gail Shaw&amp;#8217;s tip of Magnifier in my session was tough to use I&amp;#8217;ve upped my font size on my Rstudio IDE, but hadn&amp;#8217;t yet implemented this across other IDEs I tend to use my mouse cursor to draw attention to things.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a wee while due to SQLBits disruptions and a crazy work schedule but here&amp;#8217;s some of what I&amp;#8217;ve been reading recently:

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/working-with-azure-blob-storage-some-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working on building a snazzy &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/Rtraining/blob/master/inst/slidedecks/shiny/Dashboards.Rmd&#34; title=&#34;My shiny presentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;shiny&lt;/a&gt; app that a) drops the inputs/parameter values into &lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/storage-introduction/&#34; title=&#34;Azure storage intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blob storage&lt;/a&gt; and b) uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/stream-analytics/&#34; title=&#34;Stream Analytics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stream Analytics&lt;/a&gt; to query the values and present back what people are saying at the moment. This&amp;#8217;ll be a fab tool for &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/r-pre-con-sqlsat-exeter/&#34; title=&#34;My R Pre-Con: SQLSat Exeter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my pre-con next month&lt;/a&gt; if I can get it working in time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting it working, does however mean utilising the &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd179355.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Storage API documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Azure Blob Storage API&lt;/a&gt; in R which I confess is much harder than expected, especially after the ease of using the Visual Studio Online API for &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/bride-of-frankenstein-tfs-r/&#34; title=&#34;Bride of Frankenstein: TFS + R&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tfsR&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, I thought I&amp;#8217;d write-up some of my findings before I do a bigger write-up that illustrates how to do everything (in R).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working my way through an &lt;a href=&#34;http://justazure.com/azure-blob-storage-part-one-introduction/&#34; title=&#34;Just Azure - working with blob storage&#34;&gt;intro to azure storage&lt;/a&gt; on the (hopefully reasonable) expectation that more knowledge will make it easier to work with. There&amp;#8217;s additionally the &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dd135733.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Blob Storage REST API&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online reference&lt;/a&gt;, although I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/integrate/api/overview&#34; title=&#34;Visual Studio Online REST API documentation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VSO REST API&lt;/a&gt; documentation easier to understand and get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been asked by a few people recently about why I don&amp;#8217;t use Azure Machine Learning (ML). I answer that I don&amp;#8217;t use it yet, and the reason being that at the moment the robust development life-cycle isn&amp;#8217;t in place around it. I think that will change &amp;#8211; one of the great reasons for the acquisition of Revolution Analytics (in my opinion) is their DeployR system.
DeployR is essentially an R web service platform.</description>

      <title>Bride of Frankenstein: TFS &#43; R</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/bride-of-frankenstein-tfs---r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The unholy abomination of trying to use TFS as my central repository for my R code over the past year has been tough and you may or not be looking at the screen as if I&amp;#8217;m a crazy fool for even trying. Of course, now I have good news, because I&amp;#8217;ve broken the back of the main issue I had with TFS. The crucial link was being able to programatically create Git repositories within a single project for small projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the API, I&amp;#8217;ve been able to write an &lt;a title=&#34;tfsR&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/tfsR&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R package&lt;/a&gt; with functions that now save me at least 15 minutes of time and effort each time I want a new project. So I can happily holler &amp;#8220;IT&amp;#8217;S ALIVE!!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overcoming social anxiety to attend user groups</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/overcoming-social-anxiety-to-attend-user-groups/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some people it might sound silly, but a frequent reason why people don&amp;#8217;t sign up or don&amp;#8217;t make it to their local user group is to do with social anxiety. I totally understand this &amp;#8211; a room full of people you don&amp;#8217;t know can be a daunting experience. I still get nervous when attending a new user group for the first time and I run three user groups, and speak at user groups and conferences all round the country!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post takes you through the worries, and explains how I&amp;#8217;ve approached some of the issues. Hopefully, this&amp;#8217;ll help you get more people in to your local user group and learning, whether it&amp;#8217;s because you have the tools to help yourself, or understand and can help others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entering into the world of SQL Server around the same time as the 2008 release has meant that until the past couple of years, change in the Microsoft BI world only happened in dribs and drabs for me. SQL Server and it&amp;#8217;s BI components were stable server products and the focus was on getting data and optimising &amp;#8220;central reporting&amp;#8221;. Recently though things have started to massively change due to Azure and Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer part of Server &amp;amp; Tools where products were considered in silos, SQL Server and BI are now part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2015/01/30/increasing-visibility-for-our-customers-announcing-the-cloud-platform-roadmap-site.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Cloud Platform roadmap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s now a means of delivering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.microsoft.com/ceo/bold-ambition/index.html&#34; title=&#34;Satya Nadella&#39;s vision email&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud-first vision&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft have aligned themselves to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Shiny reports are awesome, but they sure do end up with many lines of code when adding lots of inputs and outputs. A ui.R file can rapidly exceed 50 lines of code and I prefer to keep things more compact. The best way I&amp;#8217;ve found of doing that in other languages and in R is to modularise my code &amp;#8211; break it down into independent chunks. Shiny already does this by having a server() and ui() section and allowing you to source other files.</description>

      <title>magrittr: cleaner program flow</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/magrittr-cleaner-program-flow/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 11:51:23 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/magrittr-cleaner-program-flow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I built a pretty sweet web service in R as part of the day job. However, not being well-versed in stuff like object-oriented programming, I did not do the best job of making the flow of my program particularly clear or robust. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t take multiple inputs properly and I found it to be tough to test. In spare moments, I took to cogitating how to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried simply refactoring some of the functions but found my structure too cumbersome to allow much change. I tried starting afresh with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html&#34; title=&#34;Advanced R - OO programming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;S4 system&lt;/a&gt; but was soon in a death spiral of class proliferation and no experience in how to stop it. After dabbling with different methods, I was getting pretty frustrated &amp;#8211; I want my code to be better and more maintainable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m looking at &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html&#34; title=&#34;magrittr vignette on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;magrittr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-magrittr&#34;&gt;About magrittr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;magrittr&lt;/code&gt; was designed to better facilitate &lt;a href=&#34;http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html&#34; title=&#34;R for functional programming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; based on piping inputs from one function to another. It&amp;#8217;s the same paradigm as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/ebookv2/archive/2012/03/12/chapter-5-the-powershell-pipeline.aspx&#34; title=&#34;PowerShell Pipe operator explained&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;PowerShell operator &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means you can more succinctly pass an input through various transformation steps (in contrast to my initial method) with a lot less code. The ability to add conditional functions or even new functions on the fly (aka &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function&#34; title=&#34;Lambda functions on wikipedia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lambda functions&lt;/a&gt;) with a similarly low code burden gives the added benefit of helping with branching logic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oz and I being the lazy so and so&amp;#8217;s that we are, share a profile and use it across all our devices. Our username is &amp;#8220;Steph &amp;amp; Oz&amp;#8221; which means the user folder that Windows has for us is &lt;code&gt;C:UsersSteph &amp;amp; Oz&lt;/code&gt;. Having spaces and special characters is generally not recommended, and gives interesting issues when using R, primarily at initialization and when trying to do package installations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, R will try make the user&amp;#8217;s personal folder the directory which it works under, i.e. limiting its impact on the computer overall, but it&amp;#8217;s Unix/Linux roots mean that it doesn&amp;#8217;t like you doing whacky things like ampersands in folder names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result with ours is to cause this error on load:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Error installing package: Error: ERROR: no packages specified&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8216;Oz&amp;#8217; is not recognized as an internal or external command,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;operable program or batch file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Paul Randal offers mentoring</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hot off the back of his win in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simple-talk.com/blogs/2015/01/20/tribal-awards-2014-winners-announcement/&#34; title=&#34;Tribal Awards winners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tribal Awards&lt;/a&gt;, Paul is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/want-mentored/&#34; title=&#34;Paul Randal - mentoring opportunity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;offering to mentor&lt;/a&gt; 3 men &amp;amp; 3 women for two months. To be in with a chance of getting mentored by Paul, you simply need to apply by writing a blog post about why you should be considered for mentoring and posting the link by the 15th Feb 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s an awesome offer that you should take up if possible (i.e. you&amp;#8217;re reading before the deadline) and whilst I&amp;#8217;m busy trying to convince you I&amp;#8217;m going to insert my application too. Hopefully, seeing my application will help you form your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-value-of-being-mentored&#34;&gt;What is the value of being mentored?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentoring gives you the opportunity to have someone who can assist you in the way a senior techy can when you face a technical challenge. They can give valuable advice about hidden perils, shortcuts, and point out code smells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That advice is valuable, but to get it you need to properly formulate your issue or challenge faced. Like posting on Stack Overflow, putting thought and preparation into the question gives you a deeper understanding before you even talk to your mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth noting that you can&amp;#8217;t be vague. &amp;#8220;I want to be the best&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I want to know everything&amp;#8221; is never going to happen. Mentoring is not a panacea for your entire career &amp;#8211; especially with short duration mentoring like Paul&amp;#8217;s. To get the value, you need to settle on a specific issue or challenge that you want to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organised speaking – Intro to R case study</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--intro-to-r-case-study/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2015 09:48:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--intro-to-r-case-study/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/organised-speaking-iterative-development/&#34; title=&#34;Organised speaking – presentation design&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iterative presentation design post&lt;/a&gt; I promised a case study. I thought I&amp;#8217;d cover my most presented session &lt;em&gt;Intro to R&lt;/em&gt;, in future called &lt;em&gt;Knowing your Rs from your elbow&lt;/em&gt; courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/fatherjack&#34; title=&#34;Father Jack&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@FatherJack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-history&#34;&gt;A brief history&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I&amp;#8217;ve been using R for the past couple of years and spent the first months struggling with it, I wanted to give a presentation that I would have wanted to see at the beginning. Not one about random bagging and a bunch of other stats but what are the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; ways to do the fundamentals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connecting to my database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performing data manipulations, summaries and updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;charting my data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;producing reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few packages cover these awesomely and are much better than base R so whilst I was tackling a massive stats project, the things which took the time and stress were things I could have avoided with ease!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my intro to R, takes people through the things I wish I&amp;#8217;d been taken through thus making those first few months of R pleasant, happy times!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Just a quick tip for spreadsheet users about spellchecking in Excel.
Firstly, yes you can spell check a spreadsheet.
Secondly, you do it either by going to Review &amp;gt; Check Spelling, or more easily by hitting F7 on your keyboard.
Please, please spellcheck your work &amp;#8211; it makes your work much more professional and saves you having to do it manually!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woohoo! The kind and crazy folks at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/372/eventhome.aspx&#34; title=&#34;SQLSaturday Exeter 2015 homepage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday Exeter&lt;/a&gt; accepted my submitted training day for their roster. Before I wax lyrical on the virtues of being locked in a room with me all day, I thought I&amp;#8217;d better cover the fundamentals of the event itself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the awesome video&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organised speaking – presentation design</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--presentation-design/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2015 10:52:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--presentation-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to outline my approach to presentation design, or development as I prefer to call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I consider it development? Well, it&amp;#8217;s a product that can be manually done &amp;amp; delivered but with the potential to scale to thousands of users, I&amp;#8217;d rather the product be easy to maintain &amp;amp; deploy, deliver real value to the users, and keep up with cutting edge developments in the subject. Also, I call it development because now with the use of &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; title=&#34;Rmarkdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt;, I do actually code my presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;general-presentation-design&#34;&gt;General presentation design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read and studied a lot about presentations, some of the biggest influences being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Dr. Andrew Abela and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.extremepresentation.com/&#34; title=&#34;Extreme Presentation Method&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Extreme Presentation Method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/buckwoody/&#34; title=&#34;Buck&#39;s blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Buck Woody&lt;/a&gt; and his fantastic presentation style&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2012/04/writing-better-conference-abstracts-presentations/&#34; title=&#34;Brent&#39;s blog&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brent Ozar&lt;/a&gt; and his excellent materials for presentations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Solid fundamentals in presentation training courses (things like INTRO: Intro, Need, Title, Range, Objective)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first come up with the idea for a presentation, I write the abstract for it. In the abstract I set out the tone, material covered, and outline who should attend. This abstract is my requirements doc for later me &amp;#8211; it tells me whether I&amp;#8217;m selling, educating, or entertaining and what I&amp;#8217;m doing it about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, you should always write the abstract first as not only can you write more abstracts than you can presentations but it distills the idea down and helps you think of your audience first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: The first CaRdiff R User Group meeting</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/review-the-first-cardiff-r-user-group-meeting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 14:25:05 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/review-the-first-cardiff-r-user-group-meeting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the first &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/&#34; title=&#34;CaRdiff R User Group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cardiff R User Group&lt;/a&gt; event. There were 6 people registered out of 24 CaRdiffians. In the end we had 8 people show up &amp;#8211; so a whopping third of our current membership base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we sat around the booth eating chips and drinking beer, we covered our experiences learning R to date, the trials and tribulations of our jobs and why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t drop a barbell on your nose. We had great discussions and most of us came away with new R functionality to look at!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to initially go with the three session formats I&amp;#8217;d proposed and see how things go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219775500/&#34; title=&#34;First TalkR session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TalkRs&lt;/a&gt;: evening events with talks and socialising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219691058/&#34; title=&#34;First LearnRs session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LearnRs&lt;/a&gt;: after work sessions focused on learning some new bit of R&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/events/219476537/&#34; title=&#34;First LunchRs session&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LunchRs&lt;/a&gt;: quick lunchtime sessions to talk through a problem with someone else and hopefully solve it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Photoshop image macro (or something even better!)</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/photoshop-image-macro-or-something-even-better/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2015 10:59:21 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/photoshop-image-macro-or-something-even-better/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spend &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time in Photoshop for someone in BI. Between cleaning up images, building logos for my latest project, or producing material for user groups, I probably use it at least once a week. Through it all, I usually need to produce variants, in different file formats and sizes. So it can quickly become a dozen uses of the Save As&amp;#8230; or Save for Web functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate manual work, so you can see why it was frustrating in the extreme. Then I realised how silly I was being by not having already googled for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while because my keyword searches weren&amp;#8217;t the terms Photoshop use but I found the Secret Sauce. And if you&amp;#8217;re the sort of person who&amp;#8217;d type &amp;#8220;photoshop image macro&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s how you do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organised speaking – prioritising events to speak at</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--prioritising-events-to-speak-at/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 09:57:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--prioritising-events-to-speak-at/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my ongoing series about presenting at community events and conferences, I wanted to cover the my personal thought process when it comes to prioritising what events I&amp;#8217;d like to speak at for my goal &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/throw-1-speak-1/&#34; title=&#34;Throw 1, Speak 1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Throw 1, Speak 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a massive amount of awesome SQL Server and other technology events happening out there. I even throw a SQL Server lunchtime session once a week for the user group! Then of course there&amp;#8217;s all those conferences in the UK and abroad that are worth attending. So how do I event start picking out where I&amp;#8217;d like to talk, and how do I go about getting selected for them?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conference sessions – basic web scraping in R</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/conference-sessions--basic-web-scraping-in-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2015 16:56:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/conference-sessions--basic-web-scraping-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit sad but I enjoy dissecting what sessions are submitted to conferences I&amp;#8217;m involved in or speak at. Instead of doing it primarily by eye, I&amp;#8217;ve started dabbling in web scraping in R to do it. Initially, I used RCurl and my latest snippet uses rvest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first snippet for &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlbits.com&#34; title=&#34;SQLBits&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; bit of R code uses &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/&#34; title=&#34;RCurl on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RCurl&lt;/a&gt; but it&amp;#8217;s cumbersome, plus for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/372/schedule.aspx&#34; title=&#34;SQLSaturday Exeter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday Exeter&lt;/a&gt; there is SSL to contend with. Using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/&#34; title=&#34;rvest on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rvest&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy and it was an excellent excuse to get around to using &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/&#34; title=&#34;magrittr on CRAN&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;magrittr&lt;/a&gt;, Hadley Wickham&amp;#8217;s pipe code paradigm for R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogger tip: I also wanted the opportunity to see how Gists imported into WordPress &amp;#8211; you just c&amp;amp;p the url in (into the code, no URL markup) and WordPress automatically pulls in the Gist. For more info on this see &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/&#34; title=&#34;Wordpress support - Gist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;WordPress&amp;#8217; article on Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Not quite part of being organised at speaking, but bundled up in part of my scheduling constraints for speaking is when I&amp;#8217;m throwing user group events. Here&amp;#8217;s the details of the user groups I&amp;#8217;m planning on throwing to meet my goal of 1 user group event a month (not including lunch time sessions!)
SQL Server I run the SQL Server user group in Cardiff and have done a few years &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m not giving it up any time soon.</description>

      <title>Starting the Cardiff R User Group</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/starting-the-cardiff-r-user-group/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/starting-the-cardiff-r-user-group/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days any hobby of mine ends up with a user group if there isn&amp;#8217;t one already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of value I derive from being able to hear experts in their fields talk about whether they&amp;#8217;re on stage or in the audience is phenomenal. Also, it&amp;#8217;s really great way to meet like-minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with the benefits in mind, 2 years of R under my belt, and a new starter in work, the time seemed ripe for an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;  title=&#34;Cardiff R&#34;&gt;R user group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/organised-speaking--throw-1-speak-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up from my last post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/organised-speaking-session-abstracts/&#34; title=&#34;Organised speaking – session abstracts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;maintaining my session abstracts&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to cover how I&amp;#8217;m doing my scheduling this year for speaking at events. Perhaps more importantly than tech, is the intention and the planning process so I&amp;#8217;ll be covering these factors in more detail than the tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make use of Google services quite a bit, and their &lt;a href=&#34;http://calendar.google.com&#34; title=&#34;Google calendar&#34;&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt; system is a great help. So this year I&amp;#8217;ve added a calendar that has all mine (and hopefully Oz&amp;#8217;s) speaking engagements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m then utilising a WordPress plugin called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.org/plugins/gcal-events-list/&#34; title=&#34;Gcal events&#34;&gt;GCal events&lt;/a&gt; to connect to the calendar and pull the info into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/wheres-steff-oz/&#34; title=&#34;Where’s Steff &amp;amp; Oz?&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;throw-1-speak-1&#34;&gt;Throw 1, Speak 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal this year is to throw one user group event and speak at one event each month.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve been using this blog more recently, the page speed has been becoming much more frustrating. So today, I&amp;#8217;ve done some stuff to improve it and it&amp;#8217;s now twice as fast as it used to be. Please let me know what you think of the new style!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organised speaking – session abstracts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I spoke at 10&amp;nbsp;different events (I think) and was very lucky to be nominated in the Tribal Awards for my Intro to R session. I did just a couple of different session titles and I don&amp;#8217;t think I managed the whole process very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be an easier speaker to deal with, I&amp;#8217;m trying to be more organised so that the selection process of myself &amp;amp; topics is easier whilst also ensuring I don&amp;#8217;t develop too many presentations at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having dealt with awesome serial speakers, &lt;a href=&#34;http://koprowskit.eu/geek/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tobiasz Koprowski&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://dcac.co/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Denny Cherry&lt;/a&gt;, from the organiser end they did a few things which made it much easier to deal with them, particularly given the breadth of topics they can cover!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregate on a Lookup in SSRS</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/aggregate-on-a-lookup-in-ssrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 12:59:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/aggregate-on-a-lookup-in-ssrs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-what&#34;&gt;The What&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to join multiple datasets inside SSRS, perhaps because of different sources, grains of detail etc, then you often need to aggregate over both datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SSRS, you can easily perform aggregations over another dataset but it can be tough to do this based on a grouping factor in your main dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key example of this might be Sales and Purchases &amp;#8211; you want to show both of these by month but they come from two different data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could build two tables that appear to be just one table but this can be really clunky. Instead, you want just one table with the month, the total sales, and the total purchases in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s no tidy way of doing this built in, you have the power to add your own functions to SSRS using the Code window of the report&amp;#8217;s properties. Provided here is a block of VB script that can be added to your SSRS report to allow you to do those tricky aggregations as if they were just another built in function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it AggLookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The basics of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/the-basics-of-common-table-expressions-ctes/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/the-basics-of-common-table-expressions-ctes/</guid>
      <description>Another quick post off the back of a SQL Lunch a did a while ago. Explore it via SQLFiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/ad7f5/7/0
What is a CTE? A Common Table Expression (CTE) is essentially a function defining a relation instead of a table.
This function outputs a table (like all queries) that is only present within the session, but data isn&amp;#8217;t stored in tempdb like with a temporary table.
Why CTE&amp;#8217;s? CTEs are designed primarily to allow recursion within SQL &amp;#8211; like a loop but ideal at working with hierarchies.</description>

      <description>Almost into July and I haven&amp;#8217;t posted a single thing in this blog!
Shameful of me to be sure &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been learning but not sharing. So what&amp;#8217;s been happening?
Well I moved into a new job at a brand new startup where I&amp;#8217;ve been primarily doing R, modelling, and finally getting my hands back into SQL Server! That&amp;#8217;s been keeping my day&amp;#8217;s and parts of my nights busy. I&amp;#8217;m also working on a startup at home with Oz called Clocksmith Games.</description>

      <description>After dipping Cardiff&amp;#8217;s collective toes into the world of local SQL Server conferences, we&amp;#8217;re doing it again in November. We&amp;#8217;re taking registrations, and volunteers are always welcome. If an all day conference is a bit too much, why not try out a lunchtime or evening event?
There are 9 other events around the country which you can attend as well as / instead of Cardiff, including Bristol where I&amp;#8217;ve the privilege of speaking along with some excellent folk like Klaus Aschenbrenner.</description>

      <title>R for database and Excel people</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/r-for-database-and-excel-people/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-r&#34;&gt;What is R?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R is a statistical language for doing all sorts of analytics based on many different types of data and it&amp;#8217;s also an open source platform that allows people to extend the base functionality.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/about.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt; are available from the horse&amp;#8217;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-give-it-a-go&#34;&gt;How can I give it a go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; an awesome development environment for R.  There is also an excellent online &lt;a href=&#34;http://tryr.codeschool.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R learning site&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not recommend sticking with just R &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re used to a lot more convenience and good development bits and bobs like IntelliSense and Rstudio really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

  It&amp;#8217;s a nightmare when I&amp;#8217;m trying to find out what&amp;#8217;s clogging up my hard drive, particularly now that I have an SSD and can no longer be quite so lazy and sprawling with myriad files and downloads.  This is the case even after moving most contents to Dropbox and putting this on my slow 1Tb harddrive. It can get really tiresome to be running out of space and having to trawl through, right-clicking on different folders.  It was boring but it was how you did it, well now I am enlightened, and now I don&amp;#8217;t have to pour my time down the drain.

      <title>Marketing for SQLRelay – In the beginning</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/marketing-for-sqlrelay--in-the-beginning/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2013 11:30:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/marketing-for-sqlrelay--in-the-beginning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After organising &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlrelay-stef.eventbrite.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLRelay&lt;/a&gt; for June 24th in Cardiff, as part of the national series of 8 events.  We&amp;#8217;re gearing up for November with the aim of being able to capitalise on the growing knowledge of SQL Server 2014 CTP and pushing the Relay into a less busy part of the UK community schedule.  The difficulty is that where we had more than 6 months to prep for the previous Relay, this time round we had less than 5.  What this means for me, is not only do I want to run a bigger and better Cardiff event, but I also (being a glutton for punishment) took on spearheading the marketing efforts for the whole shebang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details will be released next week on the launch, but given my lack of knowledge about anything social media this has already been a major undertaking for me, and I thought it might be of value for me, future me, and my dear readers to compile information and learnings as I go along so that it&amp;#8217;s easier to implement in future for other marketing endeavours.  It also provides an area for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do I use &lt;a title=&#34;Dynamic named ranges – the basics&#34; href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/dynamic-named-ranges-the-basics/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dynamic named ranges&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I work, most reports are exposed via a web front-end and Excel can create an external connection and retrieve the information.&amp;nbsp; This is much safer than using direct database connections in workbooks.&amp;nbsp; A problem with web queries though is that they cannot be converted to Tables in order for referencing columns and the dataset as a whole to be made easier.&amp;nbsp; As a result, dynamic named ranges are a necessity for producing easy to develop and manage spreadsheets since the volumes in the raw data can change over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I save myself time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A raw data table with 20 columns will take a long time to create the named ranges for, given that I want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dynamic range covering the headers too for pivot tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dynamic range without headers for vlookups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dynamic range for each column without headers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a macro, assigned to a nice button on my ribbon, to generate all the relevant ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the special considerations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structure &amp;#8211; raw data tables should ALWAYS be set up in a specific way &amp;#8211; with the Primary Key on the left hand side and always filled in, with no empty rows or columns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special characters &amp;#8211; range names can&amp;#8217;t contain special characters.&amp;nbsp; The VBA uses the &lt;a title=&#34;RegEx functions in VBA&#34; href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/index.php/regex-functions-in-vba/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RegEx&lt;/a&gt; functionality to strip these out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numbers &amp;#8211; range names can&amp;#8217;t have numbers either.&amp;nbsp; We can&amp;#8217;t just strip out the numbers like we would special characters because they might be important like Grade1, Grade2 and Grade3 and collapsing them all to the name Grade would be a problem.&amp;nbsp; Instead, the macro converts all numbers to the corresponding letter in the alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much the data will grow?&amp;nbsp; By default I set the macro to use 10 times the number of records present when I run the macro &amp;#8211; if it&amp;#8217;s already bigger than 25k rows, the number will need to be reduced, and if I don&amp;#8217;t think 10 times the number will be adequate, I&amp;#8217;ll increase the number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Regular Expressions (RegEx) is a common string processing technique for handling strings that conform to patterns, as opposed to fixed strings.XKCD Perl Problems
It is an excellent set of functionality that is available in most programming languages, and even in SQL. It is however not readily available in Excel or VBA. This has it downsides if you&amp;#8217;re trying to complex string matching and extraction, so in my personal workbook, I include the RegEx functions available at http://www.</description>

      <description>Whoah nelly, what&amp;#8217;s a named range first of all let alone a dynamic one?
A named range is a shorthand or alias for a set of cells in Excel. These can be created easily by simply selecting one or more cells and using the name box to give it whatever name you feel relevant. This alias can then be used in formula to make something much more insightful like =A1_VAT as opposed to =A1_0.</description>

      <description>My Day/Night Cycle Here&amp;#8217;s my Day/Night cycle function demo, built in Construct 2. (Time moving at 4 minutes per second)
It took me a day and a half of hair pulling, but I&amp;#8217;ve only been using Construct 2 for a week so I suppose it&amp;#8217;s not too shabby. It uses only 6 events, 2 global variables and 9 objects.</description>

      <title>Synchronising schema between MSSQL &amp; MySQL with SSIS</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/synchronising-schema-between-mssql--mysql-with-ssis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 16:25:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/synchronising-schema-between-mssql--mysql-with-ssis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system we need to report on that is form based.  Whenever there is a new form, there is a new table, and whenever there is a new or amended* field on the form, there is a new column in the table.  Maintaining the imports of this data into a staging environment would require a lot of code and time to build manually from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is required is something that goes through the two schema for all relevant objects and updates our staging area’s schema accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points for consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the level of change in source system, all loads are dynamically generated SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads run from a data dictionary table, which needs to be updated when we update the schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads occur daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Making charts with conditionally coloured series</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/making-charts-with-conditionally-coloured-series/</link>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/making-charts-with-conditionally-coloured-series/</guid>
      <description>The example I&amp;#8217;m running through is available at http://sdrv.ms/11lH3KR
&amp;nbsp;
The scenario we&amp;#8217;re looking at is where we want to be able to convey quality within a chart by having differently coloured columns, based on different conditions that we want to specify. Unfortunately, the ability to natively apply conditional formatting isn&amp;#8217;t yet present, but we can mimic it by overlaying series of the same size that are coloured differently.

      <title>Center across selection</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/center-across-selection/</link>

      <description>Merging cells is easily done and can help make a spreadsheet look neat, but what you really, really should be doing instead is centering across the selection so it looks merged but isn&amp;#8217;t. Center across selection though is hidden away and therefore time-consuming to use &amp;#8211; no wonder people have bad habits! I wanted to do things the better way, but was lazy, so in the end I made a macro to go in my personal workbook and assigned it to my ribbon (I do this a lot).</description>

      <description>I do a lot of work in spreadsheets and some cannot be left open on my PC as that&amp;#8217;d make them locked for the morning report refresh. After a bunch of times having to buy cakes for so delaying the reports, I put something in place to stop it. It also had the very nice side effect of telling me to go home.
The first thing to do is make sure you have a personal workbook.</description>

      <title>Objectless Check Boxes using VBA</title>
      <link>http://lockelife.com/blog/objectless-check-boxes-using-vba/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2013 14:03:09 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/objectless-check-boxes-using-vba/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my first ever blog post (be gentle with me!) I wanted to talk about an issue I have with Excel’s check box object, and my way of resolving it. It’s not perfect, and I’d love to hear of any other versions or ideas you may have. So here&amp;#8217;s how I create check boxes in Excel without using Excel check boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-with-check-box-objects&#34;&gt;The Problem with Check Box Objects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look good and they work well, there’s no denying they do what they’re supposed to, but they also annoy the heck out of me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;list-style-type: circle;&#34;&gt;
  As far as I’ve been able to find they can’t be properly bound to a cell; this means if you want to get rid of them you need to select them and delete them, which can be a big job
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;list-style-type: circle;&#34;&gt;
  If you want to refer to their state in simple terms you need to add a linked cell and refer to that, which to me is just plain messy
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;list-style-type: circle;&#34;&gt;
  They’re awkward to format and style and if you want a big tick you need a big box and as such you need a big cell… again, messy
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #99cc00;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up WordPress on Azure</title>

      <guid>http://lockelife.com/blog/setting-up-wordpress-on-azure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog was configured super rapidly with goDaddy and Azure, instead of my previous implementation on EC2.  I&amp;#8217;ve forgone the multi-site installation, with attendant subdomains, and gone for a straight wordpress Website (one of the Azure features).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had an Azure account I&amp;#8217;d gone through the billing setup for &amp;#8211; but that was really simple anyway, so getting the blog up and running consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
