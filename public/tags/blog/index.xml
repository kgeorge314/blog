      <title>Using blogdown with an existing Hugo site</title>

      <description>If you decide you want to use R in your existing Hugo blog, it’s really easy to convert over. There’s a single command you need to know from blogdown and the rest is working out your deployment process.
To create content, use the blogdown Rstudio add-in to quickly get started. This niftily reads all tags and categories from past posts to help you get going.
knitr::include_graphics(&amp;quot;usingblogdownaddin.jpg&amp;quot;) You can then write Rmarkdown as usual.</description>

      <title>An experiment in self-promotion – Revive Old Posts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been writing (not enough) blog posts for a while now and have built up some neat stuff in the backlog if I may so myself. Alas, a lot of this doesn&amp;#8217;t get seen because it&amp;#8217;s not on the front page or in the top 5 blog posts. Sad that posts like my one on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/anchor-modelling-sixth-normal-form-databases/&#34;&gt;sixth normal form databases&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#8217;t get enough love, I&amp;#8217;ve installed the WordPress plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/tweet-old-post/&#34;&gt;Revive Old Posts&lt;/a&gt; (ROP) to try countering this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve been using this blog more recently, the page speed has been becoming much more frustrating. So today, I&amp;#8217;ve done some stuff to improve it and it&amp;#8217;s now twice as fast as it used to be. Please let me know what you think of the new style!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where’ve we been?</title>

      <description>Almost into July and I haven&amp;#8217;t posted a single thing in this blog!
Shameful of me to be sure &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been learning but not sharing. So what&amp;#8217;s been happening?
Well I moved into a new job at a brand new startup where I&amp;#8217;ve been primarily doing R, modelling, and finally getting my hands back into SQL Server! That&amp;#8217;s been keeping my day&amp;#8217;s and parts of my nights busy. I&amp;#8217;m also working on a startup at home with Oz called Clocksmith Games.</description>
