      <description>Data Manipulation in R is now generally available on Amazon.
 All book links will attempt geo-targeting so you end up at the right Amazon. Prices are in USD as most readers are American and the price will be the equivalent in local currency.
 Data Manipulation in R is the second book in my R Fundamentals series that takes folks from no programming knowledge through to an experienced R user.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet on the blog front recently. That&amp;rsquo;s because I overhauled my site, migrating it to Hugo (the foundation of blogdown). Just doing one extra thing on top of my usual workload, I also did another thing. I wrote a book too!
I&amp;rsquo;m a big book fan, and I&amp;rsquo;m especially a Kindle Unlimited fan (all the books you can read for £8 per month, heck yeah!) so I wanted to make books that I could publish and see on Kindle Unlimited.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in an earlier post about how I&amp;#8217;m revamping my presentation slides process but that I hadn&amp;#8217;t tackled the user experience of browsing my slides, which wasted lots of the effort I put in. To tackle this part of it, I&amp;#8217;ve made lockedata.uk using Hugo to be a way of finding and browsing presentations on R, SQL, and more. As Hugo is so easy, I thought I&amp;#8217;d throw in a quick Hugo walkthrough too so that you could build your own blog/slides/company site if you wanted to.</description>

      <description>Following on from when we announced the availability of our community workshops, we&amp;#8217;ve got three in the next three months that folks can attend.
May 19th &amp;#8211; Data science project in a day We&amp;#8217;ll be in Kiev, Ukraine, doing a whole data science project in a day. This is intended to give people a little bit of code, process, and critical thinking along the whole data science workflow. This will enable folks to see how it hangs together and decide where and how much they want to invest their learning in future.</description>

      <title>Dear South Wales &amp; Bristol readers: I need your help</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/dear-south-wales--bristol-readers-i-need-your-help/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I need your help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle of the Beards is an annual tech event in Cardiff that&amp;#8217;s previously been an evening affair but is now a day-long conference. We&amp;#8217;re hosting half-hour talks on security, infrastructure, software craftmanship, front-end development, and data visualisation. We&amp;#8217;re starting out the day with bacon baps and it just gets better from there. Tickets cost £15 and there&amp;#8217;s the option to add a donation to the charity we&amp;#8217;re supporting with the event, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thecalmzone.net/&#34;&gt;Campaign Against Living Miserably&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now ticket sales are really low and without your help, we&amp;#8217;ll have to cancel the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m hoping you can help make this event succeed by doing one or both of two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&#34;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if it&amp;#8217;s of interest to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recommend it to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[button text=&amp;#8221;REGISTER&amp;#8221; color=&amp;#8221;orange&amp;#8221; link=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&amp;amp;#8221;&#34;&gt;https://battleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&amp;amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;] [button text=&amp;#8221;TWEET&amp;#8221; color=&amp;#8221;blue&amp;#8221; link=&amp;#8221;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%23tweeps%20-%20%23battleofthebeards%20is%20on%20March%2029th%20in%20Cardiff.%20You%20should%20check%20it%20out!%0Abattleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&amp;amp;#8221;&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/home?status=Hey%20%23tweeps%20-%20%23battleofthebeards%20is%20on%20March%2029th%20in%20Cardiff.%20You%20should%20check%20it%20out!%0Abattleofthebeards.eventbrite.co.uk&amp;amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Announcing community R workshops</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/announcing-community-r-workshops/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big part of why I&amp;#8217;ve launched Locke Data is so that I can give back more to my communities. I want to give more time and more support to others. One of the first steps is doing some activities that give financial support to community groups without damaging my startup cashflow! Community R workshops that fund local user groups is the first activity I&amp;#8217;ll be trialling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s involved, and what you might want to consider if you&amp;#8217;d like to be a part of this endeavour:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Giving back with code</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/giving-back-with-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/giving-back-with-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From code in answers on Stack Overflow to R packages or full programs, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of code being written and given away. This post examines some of the reasons why the people writing all that code do it, why you should consider giving back with code, and how you can get started. Finally, I cap it all off with perspectives from some of my favourite coders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#getstarted&#34;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives&#34;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why you should consider writing code and making it available for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;altruistic&#34;&gt;Altruistic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re writing something to achieve a task, odds are someone else would have to write the same code &amp;#8211; why not help them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;re using a lot of open source software, whether you realise it or not. By open sourcing your code, you get to pay it forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give others something to contribute to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown quantities are risky hires, put your code out there for the world to see and employers get to see what you can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop your skills for the next job, the one that requires you to be more skilled in something than you are now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to interact with a lot of different people who you build credibility with, and hopefully friendships!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-oneself&#34;&gt;For oneself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, the more code you write, the better your coding skills so if you want to improve your skills this is an ideal way to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the sheer fun of doing cool stuff, especially if you don&amp;#8217;t get to do cool stuff in the day job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do it &amp;#8220;the way it should be done&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>SQLSaturdays but for R?</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 19:25:22 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Proposal now being developed after fantastic community support. Check out satRdays on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and contribute your opinions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a contact from a very nice chap in Dallas a month ago about whether in the R world we do anything like SQLSaturdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about the SQLSaturdays he said was not that they&amp;#8217;re free (well it helps!) but that they&amp;#8217;re on his time. Developing his skills was something he couldn&amp;#8217;t get signed off by his boss so he wanted to be able to do it by himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In answer to the question of whether there are local(ish) weekend conferences happening regularly for R, my answer was &amp;#8220;not really&amp;#8221; and it&amp;#8217;s a shame because the R community is fantastic. I started thinking about why we don&amp;#8217;t have them and what would be needed to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free / cheap regional small-medium conferences are a must for growing user knowledge and speakers in R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
