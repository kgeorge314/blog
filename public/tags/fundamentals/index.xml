      <description>Data Manipulation in R is now generally available on Amazon.
 All book links will attempt geo-targeting so you end up at the right Amazon. Prices are in USD as most readers are American and the price will be the equivalent in local currency.
 Data Manipulation in R is the second book in my R Fundamentals series that takes folks from no programming knowledge through to an experienced R user.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty quiet on the blog front recently. That&amp;rsquo;s because I overhauled my site, migrating it to Hugo (the foundation of blogdown). Just doing one extra thing on top of my usual workload, I also did another thing. I wrote a book too!
I&amp;rsquo;m a big book fan, and I&amp;rsquo;m especially a Kindle Unlimited fan (all the books you can read for Â£8 per month, heck yeah!) so I wanted to make books that I could publish and see on Kindle Unlimited.</description>
