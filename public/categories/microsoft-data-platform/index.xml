      <description>I mentioned in an earlier post about how I&amp;#8217;m revamping my presentation slides process but that I hadn&amp;#8217;t tackled the user experience of browsing my slides, which wasted lots of the effort I put in. To tackle this part of it, I&amp;#8217;ve made lockedata.uk using Hugo to be a way of finding and browsing presentations on R, SQL, and more. As Hugo is so easy, I thought I&amp;#8217;d throw in a quick Hugo walkthrough too so that you could build your own blog/slides/company site if you wanted to.</description>

      <title>Using purrr with APIs – revamping my code</title>

      <description>I wrote a little while back about using Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs with R to first of all detect the language of pieces of text and then do sentiment analysis on them. I wasn&amp;#8217;t too happy with the some of the code as it was very inelegant. I knew I could code better than I had, especially as I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot more work with purrr recently. However, it had sat in drafts for a while.</description>

      <title>Versioning R model objects in SQL Server</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/versioning-r-model-objects-in-sql-server/</link>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/versioning-r-model-objects-in-sql-server/</guid>
      <description>High-level info If you build a model and never update it you&amp;#8217;re missing a trick. Behaviours change so your model will tend to perform worse over time. You&amp;#8217;ve got to regularly refresh it, whether that&amp;#8217;s adjusting the existing model to fit the latest data (recalibration) or building a whole new model (retraining), but this means you&amp;#8217;ve got new versions of your model that you have to handle. You need to think about your methodology for versioning R model objects, ideally before you lose any versions.</description>

      <title>How to change “No match found!” on your no-code Q&amp;A bot</title>

      <description>Last week, I blogged about building a no-code Q&amp;amp;A bot for your website. One little niggle I had with the bot was the response when it could match a user input to a Q&amp;amp;A. I wondered how to change &amp;#8220;No match found!&amp;#8221;.
I looked around the qnamaker.ai site and couldn&amp;#8217;t find a place I could change this. I submitted some feedback and the great people at the other of the Q&amp;amp;A site responded super quickly.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to have a live chat option for their site but I&amp;#8217;m frequently away, so I wanted something that people could talk to interactively. This is a perfect scenario for a Q&amp;amp;A bot. Microsoft takes a ton of the pain out of Q&amp;amp;A bots, and it was much easier than I thought to get it added to my WordPress blog. Here is a how to do it for your site.</description>

      <title>I Love Azure Functions!</title>

      <description>A while ago, I started my Stumbling Into series. I started but only got one in &amp;#8211; I was gonna talk about how I failed with Azure Functions next. I was failing because the docs outside C# (and node.js) were so limited that I found it difficult to get things done. However, I persevered and overcame a little bit of C#-ophobia and I can honestly say it has been so worth it.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been writing (not enough) blog posts for a while now and have built up some neat stuff in the backlog if I may so myself. Alas, a lot of this doesn&amp;#8217;t get seen because it&amp;#8217;s not on the front page or in the top 5 blog posts. Sad that posts like my one on &lt;a href=&#34;https://itsalocke.com/anchor-modelling-sixth-normal-form-databases/&#34;&gt;sixth normal form databases&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#8217;t get enough love, I&amp;#8217;ve installed the WordPress plugin &lt;a href=&#34;https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/tweet-old-post/&#34;&gt;Revive Old Posts&lt;/a&gt; (ROP) to try countering this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I had the tremendous pleasure of going to the Microsoft MVP Summit this week and it was a fantastic experience. It also taught me a valuable lesson &amp;#8211; I need to be an attendee more.
Microsoft award ~4,000 people their Most Valued Professional (MVP) award each year. MVPs are influential, helpful people who work with Microsoft services. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I did to get in when so many awesome folks I know haven&amp;#8217;t but I&amp;#8217;m very proud to be in receipt of the Award.</description>

      <description>Slack all the things! OK, if you haven&amp;#8217;t heard of it before Slack is kinda like IRC, kinda like Dropbox, kinda like a lot of things &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a neat place to bring together communications between your team or community, and the integrations allow you to pipe in external feeds like twitter activity or RSS. It&amp;#8217;s a great way of collaborating online and I&amp;#8217;ve found it especially useful not just within a company but within a global community.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will give you a quick run-through of adding tSQLt to an existing database project destined for Azure SQL DB. This basically covers unit testing in SSDT and there is a lot of excellent info out there, so this focuses on getting you through the initial setup as quickly as possible. This post most especially relies on the information &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilesql.club/&#34;&gt;Ed Elliot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kzhendev.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Ken Ross&lt;/a&gt; have published, so do check them out for more info on this topic!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2016 PASS Board of Directors Candidate Town Halls</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s PASS Board of Directors elections again! After a number of twitter discussions last week about the applicability of PASS outside of the US and what I think PASS is good and bad at, I thought I would engage the process instead of just being a complainy-pants. I attended all 6 town hall webinars and asked questions to all the candidates. I recommend you watch them before voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find out more about the candidates, the PASS Board of Director elections, and how to vote on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlpass.org/Elections&#34;&gt;PASS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty quiet recently, I haven&amp;#8217;t presented much, I haven&amp;#8217;t blogged much, I haven&amp;#8217;t worked on my open source projects much. All my energy left over from my major work project has been going into SQL Relay. SQL Relay is an ambitious project every year. We organise a conference that goes on tour. In previous years, I&amp;#8217;ve gone to 8 cities over two weeks. Over the past 4 years, I&amp;#8217;ve been part of organising 30 conferences.</description>

      <title>Giving back with code</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/giving-back-with-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 14:00:50 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/giving-back-with-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From code in answers on Stack Overflow to R packages or full programs, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of code being written and given away. This post examines some of the reasons why the people writing all that code do it, why you should consider giving back with code, and how you can get started. Finally, I cap it all off with perspectives from some of my favourite coders!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#getstarted&#34;&gt;Get started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#perspectives&#34;&gt;Perspectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons&#34;&gt;Because reasons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why you should consider writing code and making it available for public consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;altruistic&#34;&gt;Altruistic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re writing something to achieve a task, odds are someone else would have to write the same code &amp;#8211; why not help them out?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#8217;re using a lot of open source software, whether you realise it or not. By open sourcing your code, you get to pay it forward&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give others something to contribute to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown quantities are risky hires, put your code out there for the world to see and employers get to see what you can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop your skills for the next job, the one that requires you to be more skilled in something than you are now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to interact with a lot of different people who you build credibility with, and hopefully friendships!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;for-oneself&#34;&gt;For oneself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally speaking, the more code you write, the better your coding skills so if you want to improve your skills this is an ideal way to do it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the sheer fun of doing cool stuff, especially if you don&amp;#8217;t get to do cool stuff in the day job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do it &amp;#8220;the way it should be done&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Stumbling into … Azure Automation</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/stumbling-into--azure-automation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 09:46:12 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/stumbling-into--azure-automation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently been trying to solve the challenge of working extracting files from AWS and getting them into Azure in my desired format. I wanted a solution that kept everything on the cloud and completely avoid local tin. I wanted it to have built-in auditing and error handling. I wanted something whizzy and new, to be honest! One way in which I attempted to tackle the task was with &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/automation/&#34;&gt;Azure Automation&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll overview Automation and explore how it stacked up for what I was attempting to use it for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Task: Get compressed (.tar.gz) files from AWS S3 to Azure, decompress the files, concatenate the contents and put in a different container for analytics magic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like with most things I dropped myself into the deep-end on it so had fairly minimal knowledge of PowerShell and the Azure modules, therefore I fully expect more knowledgeable folks to wince at my stuff. General advice, &amp;#8220;you should do it like this, then this&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&amp;#8216;s, and resource recommendations are all very welcome &amp;#8211; leave a comment with them in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;azure-automation&#34;&gt;Azure Automation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azure Automation is essentially a hosted PowerShell script execution service. It seems to be aimed primarily at managing Azure resources, particularly via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.simple-talk.com/sysadmin/powershell/powershell-desired-state-configuration-the-basics/&#34;&gt;Desired State Configurations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, however, a general PowerShell powerhouse, with scheduling capabilities and a bunch of useful features for the safe storage of credentials etc. This makes it an excellent tool if you&amp;#8217;re looking to do something with PowerShell on a regular basis and need to interact with Azure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bad ways to run a user group</title>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/bad-ways-to-run-a-user-group/</guid>
      <description>I love user groups and I always want there to be more. I&amp;#8217;m not a perfect organiser but I run reasonable groups. When I see organisers doing it badly, it makes me sad. There&amp;#8217;s lots of great ways to run a user group, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d cover some of the bad ways to run a user group. The anti-patterns if you will 😀

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t think of myself as an expert because an expert is someone with very deep knowledge of a comparatively narrow field.
For better or worse, a lot of my sense of satisfaction with life derives from throwing myself into some enterprise that I don&amp;#8217;t have the people skills, the knowledge, and/or the resources for succeeding. I welcome the failures, the dead ends, the crises of faith, because if it wasn&amp;#8217;t hard it wouldn&amp;#8217;t be worth doing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really liked the way Brent showed us &lt;a href=&#34;https://ozar.me/2016/06/feedback-on-my-sqlpass-summit16-abstract-submissions/&#34;&gt;his feedback received&lt;/a&gt; and since mimicry is the best form of flattery, I thought I&amp;#8217;d go ahead and do it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t get any accepted abstracts, and I&amp;#8217;m actually grateful. The recent stresses to do with the PASS dramas aside, I would have had to use 5 days holiday time, pay for flights and hotel, and then flown out a week later for MVP Summit. Now I can attend some other conferences and/or have a Christmas break! Woo hoo 😀&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing SQL Server ODBC drivers on Ubuntu 15.04</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/installing-sql-server-odbc-drivers-on-ubuntu-15.04/</link>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/installing-sql-server-odbc-drivers-on-ubuntu-15.04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE 2016-10-21 : You can now get the ODBC 13 driver for Linux with a much smoother install process than below. Get all the relevant information on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlnativeclient/2016/10/20/odbc-driver-13-0-for-linux-released/&#34;&gt;the announcement from the Microsoft SQLNCli team blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can now get &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/server-cloud/sql-server-on-linux.aspx&#34;&gt;SQL Server ODBC drivers for Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;? Yes, no, maybe? It&amp;#8217;s ok even if you haven&amp;#8217;t since it&amp;#8217;s pretty new! Anyway, this presents me with an ideal opportunity to standardise my SQL Server ODBC connections across the operating systems I use R on i.e. Windows and Ubuntu. My first trial was to get it working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://travis-ci.org&#34;&gt;Travis-CI&lt;/a&gt; since that&amp;#8217;s where all my training magic happens and if it can&amp;#8217;t work on a clean build like Travis, then where can it work? Alas, the ODBC 13 driver doesn&amp;#8217;t work Ubuntu 14.04 so this set of instructions has been modified to provide code for Ubuntu 15.04 only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tl-dr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works, but it&amp;#8217;s really hacky right now. Definitely looking forward to the next iterations of this driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will work for Ubuntu 15.04 but 14.04 has a different set of C compilers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is currently hacky, and Microsoft are on the case for improving it so this post could quickly become out of date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very careful installing the driver on an existing machine. Due to the overwriting of unixODBC if already installed and potential compatibility issues with other driver managers you may have installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>Just a quick heads up to peeps in and around Cardiff, Wales. Later this month we&amp;#8217;re holding Battle of the Beards: Return of the Beard. Fantastic speakers with resplendent beards are joining us for our 6 sq. ft of pizza to present on advanced SQL Tricks, using PowerBI as a DBA, and stepping up to the challenge of the last minute audit.
This is a great chance to meet folks interested in the Microsoft Data Platform and learn from some incredibly knowledgable speakers.</description>

      <title>Upcoming R for Microsoft training days</title>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/upcoming-r-for-microsoft-training-days/</guid>
      <description>In May, I will be delivering two R for Microsoft training days. These two days will focus on some R fundamentals and applying these fundamentals within the Microsoft Data Platform. These training days are ideal if you know one half of the components &amp;#8211; whether that&amp;#8217;s the R bit or the Microsoft BI bit. Either way, you&amp;#8217;ll learn about the other half.
SQLBits SQLBits XV is being held in Liverpool this year and my training day is on May 4th.</description>

      <title>Anchor Modelling: Sixth Normal Form databases</title>

      <description>About Anchor Modelling Anchor Modelling moves you beyond third normal form and into sixth normal form. What does this mean?
 Not sure about the normal forms? See the normalization process in actions with this normalisation example
 Essentially it means that an attribute is stored independently against the key, not in a big table with other attributes. This means you can easily store metadata about that attribute and do full change tracking with ease.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I presented a &lt;a href=&#34;https://1drv.ms/p/s!AiZm2P6YHtSfjye0xDn_fuL80eSp&#34;&gt;lightning talk on DataOps&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlinthecity.red-gate.com/london-2015/&#34;&gt;SQL in the City&lt;/a&gt;. It was a fantastic day and a great opportunity to catch up with how the database side of things is evolving to embrace &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lightning talk was titled &lt;em&gt;DataOps &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s a thing (honest)&lt;/em&gt; and focused on what is essentially DevOps ported out of the developer sphere and into the data professional sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>SQL Relay is back on tour! Our 6th event sees us yet again touring the country bringing awesome speakers to eight cities over 2 weeks.
As usual we&amp;#8217;re improving things:
 A new platform called Attendee.Events which allows easier registration &amp;amp; speaker submission A whole bunch of webinars planned to get in the swing of things More breadth &amp;#8211; this year each event includes a dedicated track to R, machine learning etc, on top of SQL Server and business intelligence More content &amp;#8211; instead of swapping out existing slots for breadth, we added more tracks A green initiative &amp;#8230; see it on the day Improved speaker experience &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re building on last year&amp;#8217;s fun bus with the help of SQL Sentry to make it easier and more fun for speakers to do multiple events, as well as offering first timers some mentoring as most of the organisers are also speakers  You&amp;#8217;ll see a lot of announcements about Relay over the next few months, but I hope this little post inspires you to check out our events 😀</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had the pleasure of hanging out &amp;#8220;on air&amp;#8221; with Boris Hristov.
We talked open sourcing!
You can download and/or contribute to the following projects I have going:
 MeDriAnchor: the Metadata Driven Anchor model system. You get to have a lot of fun with 6NF! optiRum: a useful package for R, especially for the UK tfsR: for my own special brand of crazy, working with TFS git repositories in R  James Skipwith (the other major developer on MeDriAnchor) presented on automation and covers MeDriAnchor &amp;#8211; you can check it out at SQLBits.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entering into the world of SQL Server around the same time as the 2008 release has meant that until the past couple of years, change in the Microsoft BI world only happened in dribs and drabs for me. SQL Server and it&amp;#8217;s BI components were stable server products and the focus was on getting data and optimising &amp;#8220;central reporting&amp;#8221;. Recently though things have started to massively change due to Azure and Office 365.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No longer part of Server &amp;amp; Tools where products were considered in silos, SQL Server and BI are now part of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2015/01/30/increasing-visibility-for-our-customers-announcing-the-cloud-platform-roadmap-site.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Cloud Platform roadmap&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s now a means of delivering the &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.microsoft.com/ceo/bold-ambition/index.html&#34; title=&#34;Satya Nadella&#39;s vision email&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud-first vision&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft have aligned themselves to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregate on a Lookup in SSRS</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/aggregate-on-a-lookup-in-ssrs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2014 12:59:13 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/aggregate-on-a-lookup-in-ssrs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-what&#34;&gt;The What&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to join multiple datasets inside SSRS, perhaps because of different sources, grains of detail etc, then you often need to aggregate over both datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SSRS, you can easily perform aggregations over another dataset but it can be tough to do this based on a grouping factor in your main dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key example of this might be Sales and Purchases &amp;#8211; you want to show both of these by month but they come from two different data sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could build two tables that appear to be just one table but this can be really clunky. Instead, you want just one table with the month, the total sales, and the total purchases in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there&amp;#8217;s no tidy way of doing this built in, you have the power to add your own functions to SSRS using the Code window of the report&amp;#8217;s properties. Provided here is a block of VB script that can be added to your SSRS report to allow you to do those tricky aggregations as if they were just another built in function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it AggLookup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The basics of Common Table Expressions (CTEs)</title>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/the-basics-of-common-table-expressions-ctes/</guid>
      <description>Another quick post off the back of a SQL Lunch a did a while ago. Explore it via SQLFiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!6/ad7f5/7/0
What is a CTE? A Common Table Expression (CTE) is essentially a function defining a relation instead of a table.
This function outputs a table (like all queries) that is only present within the session, but data isn&amp;#8217;t stored in tempdb like with a temporary table.
Why CTE&amp;#8217;s? CTEs are designed primarily to allow recursion within SQL &amp;#8211; like a loop but ideal at working with hierarchies.</description>

      <description>After dipping Cardiff&amp;#8217;s collective toes into the world of local SQL Server conferences, we&amp;#8217;re doing it again in November. We&amp;#8217;re taking registrations, and volunteers are always welcome. If an all day conference is a bit too much, why not try out a lunchtime or evening event?
There are 9 other events around the country which you can attend as well as / instead of Cardiff, including Bristol where I&amp;#8217;ve the privilege of speaking along with some excellent folk like Klaus Aschenbrenner.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-r&#34;&gt;What is R?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R is a statistical language for doing all sorts of analytics based on many different types of data and it&amp;#8217;s also an open source platform that allows people to extend the base functionality.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r-project.org/about.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;More details&lt;/a&gt; are available from the horse&amp;#8217;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-can-i-give-it-a-go&#34;&gt;How can I give it a go?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; an awesome development environment for R.  There is also an excellent online &lt;a href=&#34;http://tryr.codeschool.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R learning site&lt;/a&gt;.  I do not recommend sticking with just R &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re used to a lot more convenience and good development bits and bobs like IntelliSense and Rstudio really delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marketing for SQLRelay – In the beginning</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/marketing-for-sqlrelay--in-the-beginning/</link>

      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/marketing-for-sqlrelay--in-the-beginning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After organising &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlrelay-stef.eventbrite.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SQLRelay&lt;/a&gt; for June 24th in Cardiff, as part of the national series of 8 events.  We&amp;#8217;re gearing up for November with the aim of being able to capitalise on the growing knowledge of SQL Server 2014 CTP and pushing the Relay into a less busy part of the UK community schedule.  The difficulty is that where we had more than 6 months to prep for the previous Relay, this time round we had less than 5.  What this means for me, is not only do I want to run a bigger and better Cardiff event, but I also (being a glutton for punishment) took on spearheading the marketing efforts for the whole shebang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details will be released next week on the launch, but given my lack of knowledge about anything social media this has already been a major undertaking for me, and I thought it might be of value for me, future me, and my dear readers to compile information and learnings as I go along so that it&amp;#8217;s easier to implement in future for other marketing endeavours.  It also provides an area for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Synchronising schema between MSSQL &amp; MySQL with SSIS</title>
      <link>https://itsalocke.com/blog/synchronising-schema-between-mssql--mysql-with-ssis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2013 16:25:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://itsalocke.com/blog/synchronising-schema-between-mssql--mysql-with-ssis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system we need to report on that is form based.  Whenever there is a new form, there is a new table, and whenever there is a new or amended* field on the form, there is a new column in the table.  Maintaining the imports of this data into a staging environment would require a lot of code and time to build manually from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is required is something that goes through the two schema for all relevant objects and updates our staging area’s schema accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points for consideration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the level of change in source system, all loads are dynamically generated SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads run from a data dictionary table, which needs to be updated when we update the schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads occur daily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
