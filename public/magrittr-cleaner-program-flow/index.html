About magrittr

magrittr was designed to better facilitate functional programming based on piping inputs from one function to another. It&#8217;s the same paradigm as the PowerShell operator |.

This means you can more succinctly pass an input through various transformation steps (in contrast to my initial method) with a lot less code. The ability to add conditional functions or even new functions on the fly (aka lambda functions) with a similarly low code burden gives the added benefit of helping with branching logic.

        <p>Last year I built a pretty sweet web service in R as part of the day job. However, not being well-versed in stuff like object-oriented programming, I did not do the best job of making the flow of my program particularly clear or robust. It wouldn&#8217;t take multiple inputs properly and I found it to be tough to test. In spare moments, I took to cogitating how to improve things.</p>

<p>I tried simply refactoring some of the functions but found my structure too cumbersome to allow much change. I tried starting afresh with an <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html" title="Advanced R - OO programming" target="_blank">S4 system</a> but was soon in a death spiral of class proliferation and no experience in how to stop it. After dabbling with different methods, I was getting pretty frustrated &#8211; I want my code to be better and more maintainable!</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html" title="magrittr vignette on CRAN" target="_blank">magrittr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-magrittr">About magrittr</h2>

<p><code>magrittr</code> was designed to better facilitate <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html" title="R for functional programming" target="_blank">functional programming</a> based on piping inputs from one function to another. It&#8217;s the same paradigm as the <a href="http://powershell.com/cs/blogs/ebookv2/archive/2012/03/12/chapter-5-the-powershell-pipeline.aspx" title="PowerShell Pipe operator explained" target="_blank">PowerShell operator <code>|</code></a>.</p>

<p>This means you can more succinctly pass an input through various transformation steps (in contrast to my initial method) with a lot less code. The ability to add conditional functions or even new functions on the fly (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function" title="Lambda functions on wikipedia" target="_blank">lambda functions</a>) with a similarly low code burden gives the added benefit of helping with branching logic.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Obviously, this is a contrived example but please bear with me! I want to take a subset of the iris data and produced a multiplied version of the figures.</p>

<ul>
<li>The 1st method is my old way</li>
<li>the skeleton flow is how I mocked it together to make sure the overall logic was in place</li>
<li>The new method is how I fleshed out the component functions to deliver the results</li>
<li>The final file shows how you can build a function with multiple arguments and pass one main argument through &#8211; this is key for making conditional functions</li>
</ul>

<p>I think there&#8217;s a massive increase in readability, succinctness and, ultimately, flexibility in the component functions. In terms of flows that work well in <code>magrittr</code>, I can highly recommend <a href="http://files.meetup.com/1225993/Hadley_Wickham_pipe-dsls.pdf" title="Pure, predictable, pipeable: creating fluent interfaces with R" target="_blank">Hadley&#8217;s presentation on the topic</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/stephlocke/1749e0f9055947037ec2">https://gist.github.com/stephlocke/1749e0f9055947037ec2</a></p>

<h2 id="quirks-noticed">Quirks noticed</h2>

<p>I struggled with my first hurdle &#8211; I wanted to write a skeleton high-level process and then add the functional flesh bit by bit. This meant I wanted lots of functions which didn&#8217;t do anything but simply passed through the data unaffected initially. The syntax for so many functions that could chain was tough. In the end I settled on <code>. %&gt;% data.table</code> as <code>. %&gt;% .</code> would lead to recursion issues.</p>

<p><del datetime="2015-02-09T21:26:45+00:00"><br /> Additionally, I started off trying to make a function in the traditional syntax <code>myfnc&lt;- function(x, y) { x }</code> as I wanted to have arguments that could direct the flow inside lambda statements. Unfortunately, this didn&rsquo;t work too well as the arguments did not seem to stay in scope throughout the steps. I think this is something I need to do more RTFM / experimentation with.</del></p>

<p>Courtesy of <code>magrittr</code>s author <a href="https://twitter.com/stefanbache" title="Stephan Milton Bache" target="_blank">Stephan Milton Bache</a>, I&#8217;m able to scratch that last quirk out as it was, as anticipated, an understanding issue on my part. Damn but I love open source when this sort of assistance happens!</p>
